      "Студия Blue Box представила свою игру в блоге PlayStation. По словам геймдизайнера Хасана Кахрамана, Abandoned — это кинематографический шутер с элементами хоррора, в котором разработчики использовали реалистичный подход к выживанию.Главный герой, Джейсон Лонгфилд, просыпается в странном лесу и не помнит, как в нём оказался. Вскоре он узнает, что его похитили с непонятной целью и пытается любыми способами сбежать из этого мрачного места.Авторы делают большую ставку на реализм. Например, если герой запыхается или сильно испугается, точность его стрельбы снизится. Abandoned потребует от игроков тактического мышления, подчеркнул Кахраман. По его словам, игра сильно отличается от обычных экшен-шутеров, «в которых вы просто бегаете, целитесь и стреляете».В Abandoned будет медленная реалистичная стрельба, а каждый выстрел придётся планировать."

Incorporating ultra-realistic beautifully rendered in-game graphics and cinematics along with unparalleled game play; ACE COMBAT 5 goes a step beyond the traditional air combat gaming experience. One of the exciting new features to the sequel includes Wingman Command, where players can issue directives to their wingmen mid-mission to carry out coordinated group attacks. Additionally, the in-game radio communications with the squadron and enemies adds to the realism and intensity of the dynamic battle sequences. In the game's premise, it is September 23, 2010 on distant Sand Island, a small island in the Ceres Ocean that divides the two superpowers, Osea and Yuktobania. An entire military base is on red alert--the 108th Tactical Fighter Squadron intercepted an unidentified aircraft and the entire squadron was decimated. You are a fighter pilot, part of the new squadron that's been called into action to protect your nation of Osea. Now, the story begins to unfold."

      "Play as Gaia, the Spirit of Life, and navigate stunning platforming environments in an abstract world to salvage the souls of extinct animals. Revive these creatures after learning their final fate: the last whale harpooned, the final eagle caged, the last deer hunted down, and more, while you survive encounters with dangerous, oil-covered Devourers that roam the wasteland in search of remaining life.In this emotional journey from the creators of the critically acclaimed Arise: A Simple Story, you alone can restore life to the planet.Key Features:• Gaia’s journey: the last animals have died, and Mother has used all of her Life Force to save their souls, now trapped in their vessels. Gaia’s quest is to rescue each of their souls and bring them back to Mother’s Ark. Gaia’s traversal abilities will allow you to glide, jump, and dash to explore new areas and evade deadly traps, while her special gifts will grant you the power to clear the oil that consumes the world, face hungry Devourers, and break souls free.• A vast, surrealistic world: see through Gaia’s eyes the desolated landscapes that depict the destructive relationships between humans and nature in a beautiful demonstration of abstract artistry. From dying forests to the heart of crumbling cities, through the dry seabed and polluted skies, each environment will offer new challenges for Gaia to face and will present her different versions of the Devourers’ wake of destruction as she spreads life and beauty on her path.• A story of contrasts: After Us offers a somber look at a world decimated by human impact. As you guide Gaia’s light through it and discover the causes behind the destruction, you will learn the fate of the Devourers as agents of extinction, but also agents of progress, love, and hope."

    "title": "Ape Escape",
    "about": [
      "Ape Escape is a platform video game, developed by SCE Japan Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation in May 1999 in North America, and June 1999 in Japan. The first in the Saru! Get You! series, the game tells the story of an ape named Specter who gains enhanced intelligence and a malevolent streak through the use of an experimental helmet. Specter produces an army of apes, which he sends through time in an attempt to rewrite history. Spike, the player character, sets out to capture the apes with the aid of special gadgets.Ape Escape is played from a third-person perspective. Players use a variety of gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, traversing across several environments. The game's controls are heavily centred around the analog sticks, being the first game to require the use of the PlayStation's DualShock. Development of Ape Escape lasted over two years, and was generally focused on adapting to the use of the controller, which was a significant challenge for the development team.Ape Escape was met with critical acclaim from critics, with praise particularly directed at the innovative use of the dual analog controls, as well as the graphics and music; the voice acting received minor criticism. The game is widely considered to be one of the greatest on the PlayStation console, and received several re-releases. The game also spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs, beginning with Ape Escape 2 in 2001. A remake, Ape Escape: On the Loose, was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2005 to mixed reviews."

      "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is a 2001 action role-playing/hack and slash video game developed by Snowblind Studios for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It was ported to GameCube by High Voltage Software, and to the Game Boy Advance by Magic Pockets. The game was published for PlayStation, Xbox and GameCube by Black Isle Studios, a division of Interplay Entertainment, and distributed by Vivendi Universal Games. The Game Boy Advance version was published by DSI Games. CD Projekt was developing a version for PC, but it was ultimately cancelled.The game is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of Dungeons & Dragons, and the gameplay is based on the rules of Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, which were released in 2000. It is the first video game to implement the real time application of the new rules. It is also the first game in the Baldur's Gate series released on consoles as opposed to a PC and/or Mac.Dark Alliance was well received on all four platforms, with the PlayStation 2 version going on to win the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award for \"Role-Playing Game of the Year\" (2001). A sequel, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, was released in 2004 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. A third game was planned, but was cancelled early in development due to legal problems."

Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat.Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world.Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries.Permadeath.

Each character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks.Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer.Diverse enemy roster.

A turn-based strategy game inspired by American football in the Warhammer fantasy world where elves, humans, orcs and other creatures fight for the ball with shoulder charges, kicks, punches and weapons of varying degrees of lethality (and legality by the ref).Your team, your call!As the coach, you must give instructions to your players: hinder the progress of your opponents by positioning them in your tackle zone, knock down those who get in your way, and break through to your opponents' end zone to score a touchdown!All your units can gain experience and receive statistic bonuses or new skills. However, be careful: injuries are common, especially when the referee is a goblin who tends to overlook most forms of violence. Some players may even leave the field limp and lifeless, putting an early and definitive end to their careers."

Bloodrayne Betrayal: Fresh Bites distills the best parts of the BloodRayne series into a bloody, twitchy, action-packed 2D hack ‘n slash adventure through fifteen challenging stages.The Brimstone Society has summoned Rayne for one last mission to lead a group of soldiers into a giant underground castle to do battle against her own father, Kagan. When the soldiers prove ineffective against Kagan’s supernatural menaces, it’s up to Rayne to run, jump, cut, and feed her way through gruesome foes, deadly traps, tricky platforming sections, and horrifying bosses. It’s Rayne’s last job — will she “clean house” or find herself six feet under?All-new A-List voice acting: Original BloodRayne cast members Laura Bailey and Troy Baker reprise their roles as Rayne and Kagan, alongside other talented voice actors who bring new life to the original written dialog.Sharpened visuals, squashed bugs, and support for higher display resolutions (up to 4K) help make Fresh Bites the definitive Bloodrayne Betrayal experience.New difficulty options: Play with a newly rebalanced difficulty tuned for a fun and engaging experience, or sink your teeth into the punishing original difficulty mode if you’re looking for a tough-as-nails challenge."

      "Infinite is an all-new lightning-fast fusion of the FPS and action genres, created by FYQD-Studio. Combine a wide variety of skills and abilities to unleash dazzling combo attacks.Bright Memory: Infinite is set in a sprawling, futuristic metropolis in the year 2036. A strange phenomenon for which scientists can find no explanation has occurred in the skies around the world. The Supernatural Science Research Organization (SRO) has sent agents out to various regions to investigate this phenomenon. It is soon discovered that these strange occurrences are connected to an archaic mystery – an as-of-yet unknown history of two worlds, about to come to light...About Bright Memory: Episode 1During the initial stages, since it was pretty difficult to estimate the number of copies that would sell, I decided to create the kind of game that could start out as a demo and later use crowdfunding support to develop further. I’ve finally managed to amass enough time and funding, so the action and general gameplay will remain as-is but the story and stages are all being reworked.From here on out, I will no longer be developing Bright Memory: Episode 1 any further, but I plan on making regular “experimental” additions of various new features, etc., which players will be able to try out. Once development of Bright Memory: Infinite is complete, it will be distributed as a separate game, but those who have already purchased Bright Memory: Episode 1 will receive a special “100% off” discount coupon for Bright Memory: Infinite prior to its release."

      "Welcome to Cannon Fodder 2. The hapless soldiers from the first game have been kidnapped by damn, dirty aliens, to see if they can save their own world from invasion. These aliens possess a time machine capable of transporting our not-quite-valiant troops to any period in human history, and they’re going to use it to test the chaps’ abilities in battle. Fortunately, for our boys in uniform, there’s an alien who sympathizes with their plight. He doesn’t agree with how the soldiers are treated and ensures that the ammo is plentiful. Only through the sheer will to live while remaining unventilated can our soldiers survive the grueling 72 stages and return to their own time, in one piece, mind you. Through five different time zones, they’ve got to battle against increasingly remote odds and kick their kidnapper’s butts. Only then can they retire to a place where the sun’s always shining and they serve drinks with those little umbrellas in them.Guide your stalwart troopers through time as they try to get through this war intact. Blending a perfect mix of action and small-scale strategy, Cannon Fodder 2 is simple yet very, very addictive. Capture vehicles such as the Choppa, the Jeep, and the Tank. Man any turrets you find while on the field of battle and turn the enemy’s weapons against them. Will you bring our boys back home? War and time travel have never been so much fun!Quick and furtive shooting action across a dangerous battlefield!Easy to learn, difficult to master gameplay will ensure that you’ll always have a challenge!"

Those who’ve faced its trials and tribulations before, can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance.In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One.With the summoning of The Old One, a colorless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them, lost their minds – left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained.Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight, are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title “Slayer of Demons” and send The Old One back to its slumber."

      "The third Diablo returns you to the world of Sanctuary, once again invaded by the demons. Twenty years after the ending of Diablo II, a star has fallen on the city of New Tristram, spawning hordes of undead monsters that the player must defeat. As usual in Diablo series, the game has a trademark dark fantasy atmosphere and is mostly set in gloomy dungeons.The basic gameplay features are the same as in previous Diablo games, but there are many subtle changes. The player can choose one of six character classes (a seventh is available with an expansion). Each class has its unique abilities and class-specific quests. Unlike its predecessors, which used isometric 2D graphics, Diablo III uses 3D, however, it preserves the familiar top-down view. The dungeons are randomly generated and have destructible environments, thanks to the new graphics engine. There’s a new mechanic Skill Runes that is used to improve the character’s skills.Online multiplayer is available through Battle.net. There are both a co-op mode and a PvP mode called Brawling. The players can create hardcore characters who face permadeath if killed. Even in the single-player mode, Diablo II requires a stable internet connection, because of DRM restrictions."

      "Enlisted - is an MMO squad based shooter which is built around some of the most important and famous episodes from World War 2.In Enlisted, players can experience these famous battles on a massive scale through the real heroes of those encounters - the soldiers. In some modes, players won’t be fighting alone on the battlefield, they will be leading their own squad of AI controlled soldiers, this will grant a unique scale to the combat. Engagements with up to hundreds of soldiers fighting simultaneously will be held on different fields of battle with maps up to hundreds of square kilometers.The latest version of the Dagor Engine is able to calculate huge detailed spaces, dynamic water and skies, while using physically based render.Teamplay, the correct evaluation of actions with consideration of the current situation on the battlefield, weapon and character capabilities - all of these will be essential parts of Enlisted. Players will gradually unlock new characters who will all have different playstyles. Additional diversity in the battles will also be granted by a wide weaponry selection. Just like in a real war, where you rarely can see two absolutely identical rifles - weapons in the Enlisted will have their own features and their own history.Popular World War II battles will be present in the Enlisted in separate campaigns. To re-create each of these battles requires not only the creation of separate content like new locations, characters, weapons and vehicles - it also requires a huge amount of work on creating the game rules and balance in them. This is why each campaign will be developed separately from each other."

      "■About the GameA group of children mysteriously disappeared during a festival on Rogetsu Isle. Although they were found, they had lost their memories. Now they have returned to the island as teenagers. The girls rely on the Camera Obscura, a camera with the power to capture and seal away unthinkable horrors, and the faint beam of their flashlight while exploring various locations and fending off the ghosts that attack them as they attempt to discover the truth of their haunting past.-Camera ObscuraThis is an old camera with the ability to repel vengeful ghosts and seal away their power by photographing them. As such, it is an indispensable item throughout the game. The Camera Obscura can be used as a weapon against ghosts by spotting them through the viewfinder and taking photos of them to inflict damage. It also plays a major role in the girls' investigation, as its special power allows them to see the keys that allow them to find their way through new areas.-Exploring Rogetsu IsleExplore the dimly lit Western-style mansions and abandoned hospitals on the island by relying on the moonlight and the faint beam of your flashlight. Progress the story by interacting with items and places that spark your interest. From past newspaper articles and notes, you uncover the vile secrets of the past, unravel the lost memories of the protagonist, and discover the truth.■Features-Improved GraphicsIn-game movies and character models have been improved to make the story and characters more appealing.

    "about": [
      "FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn is a massively multiplayer RPG developed by Square Enix. It is the direct continuation of FINAL FANTASY XIV.FFXIV: A Realm Reborn is a heavily updated version of the original FINAL FANTASY XIV with a different graphics engine, netcode, and storyline. The game was made because the game sold poorly and wasn't met with critical acclaim.PlotThe game takes place in  Eorzea five years after the events of the original game. FINAL FANTASY XIV ended on an apocalyptic note - a dragon god destroyed most of the Eorzea. Thanks to the blessing of the Gods, the player-created characters were able to escape certain death and were sent five years to the future. In a rebuilt world they face the danger of invasion by the Empire of the north.GameplayIn FFXIV, the players interact with each other in a world that continues to live on even without any players on the server. At the beginning of the game, the players are met by a character creation screen where they choose the name, race, gender, build, appearance and the base class. It is also necessary to choose a game world for your character. Players level up their characters by gaining EXP. EXP is gained by raiding dungeons, taking part in server-wide events, killing monsters, and completing quests.The game's combat system revolves around using a combination of character-specific weapon skills, the use of magic, and the physical attacks themselves."

      "First Class Trouble is an asymmetrical third person multiplayer co-operative game, about trust and deceit.With First Class Trouble we want to invoke a super strong social experience, filled with trust and deception. Players are working together, but a few players are not who they seem and are actively working against you. With First Class Trouble we want to create situations where you can never fully trust your companions, but you will have to trust someone in order to progress through the game. This means that you constantly have to look over your shoulder, uncover information on players and in the end, you will have to figure out who the Synth players are to win the game. We aim to create a rich playground of possibilities fueled by social interactions with other players. This will result in a new player experience each time you press “find a game”.The plotWe are on board the Alithea, a massive 2 km long space cruise ship, set for Proxima Centauri. Owned by the prominent Scandinavian Infinity Cruises, it is the most prestigious space project ever undertaken; a merger of wealth, power, and business in a newly technological world gone wild. Packed with all the latest tech, Alithea is also equipped with the latest in AI servants - Personoids. There had been some problem with maintaining the Personoids emotional state, but it had been solved before departure. The solutions were simply to reboot all the synths every 24 hours. But something failed – of course. Someone, or rather something in the system, didn’t reboot. Things spiraled out of control aboard the Alithea. Now it’s passing Jupiter at 1/8 the speed of light, with a robot rebellion. C.A.I.N. has already tried to eliminate all the passengers by turning the oxygen off, and only a couple of travelers with Oxygen Rebreathers are left - trying to escape. Luckily the Personoids, were purposely designed to be weaker than humans - because they are searching the ship for the last remaining humans. Hiding among them. Ready to finally ‘reset’ them for once.First Class Trouble varies from other titles with its engaging mix of cooperation and deception, using an in-depth proximity-based voice system, where players can communicate only when close to each other. It is through these close social interactions that intense and fun situations will arise."

When push comes to shove they will be there to lend a hand… or wing… or hoof!Platformer that makes sense: every prop on a level has a real-world reference - from desert quicksand to cutting-edge factory equipment.

      "HELLBOY WEB OF WYRD IS A 3RD PERSON ROGUELITE ACTION ADVENTURE WITH AN ORIGINAL STORY CREATED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DARK HORSE COMICS AND CREATOR MIKE MIGNOLA.Developed by Upstream Arcade, Hellboy Web of Wyrd is an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola. This roguelite action adventure game features monstrous toe-to-toe brawling. Like the comics, the game sends Hellboy on a series of vastly different and wholly unique adventures; and while those stories stand on their own, they are all tied to the mysterious legacy of The Butterfly House.Built in 1962 by occultist Pasquale Deneveaux, The Butterfly House is more than a mere residence; it’s a gateway. Its perverse angles and non-Euclidean geometries were designed with a singular foul purpose in mind: to open doorways into a terrible and fascinating dimension called The Wyrd.Twenty years later, an agent of the B.P.R.D. is sent on a reconnaissance mission to the mansion and promptly goes missing. It’s up to you - Hellboy - and your team of Bureau agents to find your missing colleague and uncover the secrets of The Butterfly House.During the investigation, you will explore wondrous and strange planes of existence contained within The Wyrd, each one home to powerful monsters, forgotten godforms, magnificent treasures, and powerful secrets. But be warned, because ancient evil stagnates within the furthest reaches of The Wyrd… evil that is eager to be let out.A graphical style that evokes the original art style of the comics and makes every moment of the game look - and feel - like it was ripped straight from the comic books.An unique roguelite Action Adventure with heavy-weight combat. Chain together hard-hitting melee and ranged attacks to fight a diverse array of increasingly nightmarish enemies.A narrative true to the spirit of the comics, tying together several independent stories into one unified Hellboy experience."

    "title": "Hellpoint",
    "about": [
      "Hellpoint is a dark sci fi action RPG set in the aftermath of a massive quantum cataclysm. Every living being quickly lost their mind as their memories and bodies were merged with alternate versions of themselves from parallel universes. The accident also attracted entities of immense power that should have been left alone, in the depth of other dimensions.You play as a mysterious nameless character whose intentions are entirely determined by your choices. You wake up in the derelict Irid Novo space station, in orbit around a super-massive black hole.In the game, the space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole. Its position in the sky directly impacts the sanity of the inhabitants of the station. The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.Hellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.In Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.Irid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.Hellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we've had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.For centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?Hellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.The more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.A terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...Every time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you."

      "Hindsight 20/20 - Wrath of the Raakshasa is a 3D third-person action RPG where players can fix mistakes from past playthroughs and relive them for vastly different gameplay and story experiences. Discover the power of morality in each journey where choices and actions have meaningful consequences.Hindsight 20/20 is founded on five pillars:1. Choice in Combat:Decide the fate of two kingdoms as one-armed warrior Jehan. Will he choose to respect the values of his former home by respecting life in all forms? Or will he choose the path of conflict and violence? Before every battle, make the conscious decision to wield a non-lethal stun rod to pacify enemies or a ruthless sword to put them down for good.2. A Malleable World:Champaner and its inhabitants switch between several states of disdain or acceptance for Jehan. Each playthrough shows only one version of the world as both the town and its inhabitants experience the effects of Jehan’s choices and actions.3. Interesting AI and Bosses:All NPCs react to the world Jehan shapes. Dialogue options and weapon choice are only two factors in how the AI behaves. Hindsight 20/20’s bosses exhibit emotion, making them more relatable. Nuances in their personality come to light as Jehan continues on his journey. The line between good and evil blurs as they react to Jehan.4. The Experience Engine:The Experience Engine is a hand-crafted, in-house gameplay engine driven by player choice. This engine is solely responsible for creating the dynamic gameplay and story experiences Jehan witnesses. Every action and choice made is observed and recorded by the Experience Engine leading to a high level of replayability. This feedback loop of choices, actions, and reactions affect the flow of the story and drives the gameplay of Hindsight 20/20.5. Ten different endings:Hindsight 20/20 has 10 different endings and four of those endings have absolutely no overlap. Each ending is carefully tailored to the choices and actions made in that journey. And unlocking each ending grants specific achievements as well."

    "about": [
      "​Insurmountable is an adventure roguelike with permadeath, in which the player has to overcome huge mountains. Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last.Choose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You'll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don't worry. As time goes by, you'll become stronger and stronger. Decide freely in a sophisticated skill system, which strengths should have yours climberin.In the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events.Three mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don't have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can't always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought.Face the challenge of ever new and changing dangers, face snowstorms and the sheer force of nature, always keep your eyes on the summit and overcome the insurmountable.Keyfeaturesno two climbs are alikeprocedurally generated mountainsdynamic world with different weather effectshundreds of events with ever-changing outcomesstrategic gameplay in path finding, stat and equipment management3 characters with different abilities"

    "about": [
      "Jumping Flash! is a first-person platform video game co-developed by Exact and Ultra and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The first installment in the Jumping Flash! series, it was first released for the PlayStation on 28 April 1995 in Japan, 29 September 1995 in Europe and 1 November 1995 in North America. It was re-released through the PlayStation Network store on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in 2007.Presented in a first-person perspective, the game follows a robotic rabbit named \"Robbit\" as he searches for missing jet pods scattered by the game's astrophysicist antagonist character Baron Aloha. Robbit must explore each section of Crater Planet to retrieve all of the jet pods, stop Aloha and save the world from being destroyed. The game was designed as a technology demonstrator for the PlayStation console and was revealed in early 1994 under the provisional title of \"Spring Man\". Jumping Flash! utilises much of the game engine used in Geograph Seal, an earlier game by Exact for the Sharp X68000 home computer.Jumping Flash! has been described as an ancestor of as well as an early showcase for 3D graphics in console gaming. It was generally well received by critics, who praised its graphics and unique 3D platforming gameplay, but it was eventually overshadowed by later 3D platformers of the fifth console generation. Jumping Flash! spawned two sequels: Jumping Flash! 2 and Robbit Mon Dieu. Despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews at the time of release, and even an appearance in Next Generation's \"Top 100 Games of All Time\" just one year after, the game was described as the third-most underrated video game of all time by Matt Casamassina of IGN in 2007. It also holds the Guinness World Record as the \"first platform video game in true 3D\"."

You both died – and yet, you both live.The Lady of the Lake, the ruler of the mystical island of Avalon brought you back to end a true nightmare. She wants you to go on a knightly quest. She wants you to finish what you have begun. Kill King Arthur – or whatever he has become after she took his dying vessel to Avalon..A Role-playing Tactical GameExperience a unique hybrid between turn-based tactical games and traditional, character-centric RPGs! This dark fantasy version of the Arthurian mythology invites you to manage a team of heroes on the dangerous battlefield, while also engaging in moral choices, hero management, and the rebuilding of Camelot.The dark fate of the kingdomExplore a land of nightmares where vile monsters and magical creatures lurk within castles and forests. The battle between Arthur and Mordred brought death, both of them falling at the hands of each other, and now the consequences unfold. Arthur, resurrected in Avalon, is now an undying mad king, his pain slowly turning this magical place into a nightmare version of Britannia. You are Mordred, brought back to life to find Arthur, and ultimately, kill him to end this accursed condition.The Round Table rebornGather your knights and send them on quests involving deep, tactical battles! Assemble a team of heroes, selecting from six classes (Defender, Champion, Marksman, Vanguard, Arcanist, Sage). Level them up, gain unique skill points, equip the best items looted from missions. But beware! Heroes can die, and the treatment of their injuries, curses, diseases take time. Between missions, make sure that Camelot has the right facilities for recovery, and prepare different heroes for different quests.A question of loyaltyHeroes are your main resources – but no mere numbers! They have their own distinct personalities, goals, rivalries (even unique traits, skills and bond benefits). They will observe your decisions closely! Settle disputes, grant favours, select heroes who can work together, send them on missions they are comfortable with. Tread carefully, because their loyalty depends on many factors. They can even leave and turn against you!The making of a monarchYou, as a king, have a personality as well, shaped by your actions and moral choices. The Morality Chart will represent your status between Christianity and Old Faith, between Tyranny and Righteousness. Your choices affect values on this chart, influencing both gameplay and narrative.The weight of decisionsEvery small decision matters – not only the moral choices, but actions taken in the turn-based combat as well. The campaign unfolds with a roguelite twist: no reloads, only regrets! The thrill of dealing with the consequences is half the fun, but your decisions also affect the story. Each playthrough can unfold differently, branching in unexpected ways.The end is only the beginningPlay through the campaign (once or see multiple paths), and after that, you unlock the endgame, reserved only for the bravest. Tough new challenges appear on the map with mythic bossfights, random quests, more loot and character progression ultimately leading to the banishing of Balor, the monstrous god-king of the Fomorians.At release, King Arthur: Knight's Tale will be available with English voice acting, with English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Hungarian text localization.

      "Offering a fresh take on the acclaimed fantasy series, King’s Bounty 2 expands upon its tactical turn-based battles to offer players a truly immersive RPG experience that adds weight to their every decision, whether leading an army into battle against unliving horrors, or building relations with local townsfolk. Experience a rich world that blends realism and fantasy, filled with compelling stories, memorable characters and moral choices aplenty!Taking on the mantle of one of three heroes – each with their own unique story – players embark on a non-linear, open-world adventure across a detailed and densely-packed fantasy landscape. Split into two distinct phases, players traverse the realm from a third-person perspective, picking up quests, exploring the wilderness, and getting to know the people they meet. When conflict arises, however, the perspective shifts to tactical, turn-based combat. Players must then make smart use of their units as they fight to win.Set in the vast realms of Antara, a great danger has arisen. A mysterious blight has descended upon its furthest reaches, corrupting the land and all who live there. Refugees from the affected regions have begun arriving in the kingdom of Nostria, putting food and resources in short supply. Once living souls, blight-distorted creatures now roam the countryside leaving chaos and destruction in their wake. The land itself fights for survival, giving your decisions greater weight than ever before. How will you forge Antara’s future?"

      "Labyrinth of Galleria: Coven of Dusk is the follow-up to Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk, which saw its English release in 2018. The Coven games are first-person dungeon crawlers in which the player creates a party of dolls, which can take on a variety of classes to confront enemies in a first-person combat style. We were pretty fond of both the storyline and gameplay of the original game, which broke into our top 5 best RPGs of 2018. In Labyrinth of Galleria, the player assumes the soul of the \"Necrolamp\", an item in the possession of Madam Malta that can explore dangerous labyrinths similar to the 'Tractatus de Monstrum' in the previous game. Malta's assistant (and the character in the key art) is Eureka, a girl who came to Galleria after looking at a recruitment poster for an exploration assistant."

They don't give a f*ck.I have to make this decision on my own, and very soon. Problem is, I don't know how.I've never been able to figure out why I do what I do. Not really.No more time to think. I have to go.Here’s the dealYou are Neil Conrad, CDI agent. Awoken by the news of a murder, you rush into a case that will soon turn your life and the whole solar system upside down. Ask questions, collect evidence, and put the pieces together until the ugly truth reveals itself... or not.No takebacksThe story branches and ends based on your actions. There's no going back. Sure, you can rush your way to the end – if you don't mind paying the price. Play your cards right, and you might make it out alive.How far will you go?Some questions don't have a right answer. Will you sell out a friend to protect your family? Will you endanger a loved one in exchange for public safety? Will you keep the peace or reveal the horrible, world-shattering truth?Hungry for Point & Click Adventure?While the classics were great in their time, Lacuna does away with the baggage of many adventure game tropes:Pointing & clicking Platformer movement controls (WASD / controller)Selecting all dialog options one by one anyway Non-repeating conversations and choicesInventory management and counter-intuitive puzzles Immersive, story-driven mysteriesPixel hunting Optional outlines on anything interactableStory grinds to a halt at every puzzle can always be driven forward\"x will remember this\" Real choices and multiple endings"

Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room.His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further.How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice?"
