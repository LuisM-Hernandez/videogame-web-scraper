      "Студия Blue Box представила свою игру в блоге PlayStation. По словам геймдизайнера Хасана Кахрамана, Abandoned — это кинематографический шутер с элементами хоррора, в котором разработчики использовали реалистичный подход к выживанию.Главный герой, Джейсон Лонгфилд, просыпается в странном лесу и не помнит, как в нём оказался. Вскоре он узнает, что его похитили с непонятной целью и пытается любыми способами сбежать из этого мрачного места.Авторы делают большую ставку на реализм. Например, если герой запыхается или сильно испугается, точность его стрельбы снизится. Abandoned потребует от игроков тактического мышления, подчеркнул Кахраман. По его словам, игра сильно отличается от обычных экшен-шутеров, «в которых вы просто бегаете, целитесь и стреляете».В Abandoned будет медленная реалистичная стрельба, а каждый выстрел придётся планировать."

Incorporating ultra-realistic beautifully rendered in-game graphics and cinematics along with unparalleled game play; ACE COMBAT 5 goes a step beyond the traditional air combat gaming experience. One of the exciting new features to the sequel includes Wingman Command, where players can issue directives to their wingmen mid-mission to carry out coordinated group attacks. Additionally, the in-game radio communications with the squadron and enemies adds to the realism and intensity of the dynamic battle sequences. In the game's premise, it is September 23, 2010 on distant Sand Island, a small island in the Ceres Ocean that divides the two superpowers, Osea and Yuktobania. An entire military base is on red alert--the 108th Tactical Fighter Squadron intercepted an unidentified aircraft and the entire squadron was decimated. You are a fighter pilot, part of the new squadron that's been called into action to protect your nation of Osea. Now, the story begins to unfold."

      "Play as Gaia, the Spirit of Life, and navigate stunning platforming environments in an abstract world to salvage the souls of extinct animals. Revive these creatures after learning their final fate: the last whale harpooned, the final eagle caged, the last deer hunted down, and more, while you survive encounters with dangerous, oil-covered Devourers that roam the wasteland in search of remaining life.In this emotional journey from the creators of the critically acclaimed Arise: A Simple Story, you alone can restore life to the planet.Key Features:• Gaia’s journey: the last animals have died, and Mother has used all of her Life Force to save their souls, now trapped in their vessels. Gaia’s quest is to rescue each of their souls and bring them back to Mother’s Ark. Gaia’s traversal abilities will allow you to glide, jump, and dash to explore new areas and evade deadly traps, while her special gifts will grant you the power to clear the oil that consumes the world, face hungry Devourers, and break souls free.• A vast, surrealistic world: see through Gaia’s eyes the desolated landscapes that depict the destructive relationships between humans and nature in a beautiful demonstration of abstract artistry. From dying forests to the heart of crumbling cities, through the dry seabed and polluted skies, each environment will offer new challenges for Gaia to face and will present her different versions of the Devourers’ wake of destruction as she spreads life and beauty on her path.• A story of contrasts: After Us offers a somber look at a world decimated by human impact. As you guide Gaia’s light through it and discover the causes behind the destruction, you will learn the fate of the Devourers as agents of extinction, but also agents of progress, love, and hope."

    "title": "Ape Escape",
    "about": [
      "Ape Escape is a platform video game, developed by SCE Japan Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation in May 1999 in North America, and June 1999 in Japan. The first in the Saru! Get You! series, the game tells the story of an ape named Specter who gains enhanced intelligence and a malevolent streak through the use of an experimental helmet. Specter produces an army of apes, which he sends through time in an attempt to rewrite history. Spike, the player character, sets out to capture the apes with the aid of special gadgets.Ape Escape is played from a third-person perspective. Players use a variety of gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, traversing across several environments. The game's controls are heavily centred around the analog sticks, being the first game to require the use of the PlayStation's DualShock. Development of Ape Escape lasted over two years, and was generally focused on adapting to the use of the controller, which was a significant challenge for the development team.Ape Escape was met with critical acclaim from critics, with praise particularly directed at the innovative use of the dual analog controls, as well as the graphics and music; the voice acting received minor criticism. The game is widely considered to be one of the greatest on the PlayStation console, and received several re-releases. The game also spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs, beginning with Ape Escape 2 in 2001. A remake, Ape Escape: On the Loose, was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2005 to mixed reviews."

      "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is a 2001 action role-playing/hack and slash video game developed by Snowblind Studios for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It was ported to GameCube by High Voltage Software, and to the Game Boy Advance by Magic Pockets. The game was published for PlayStation, Xbox and GameCube by Black Isle Studios, a division of Interplay Entertainment, and distributed by Vivendi Universal Games. The Game Boy Advance version was published by DSI Games. CD Projekt was developing a version for PC, but it was ultimately cancelled.The game is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of Dungeons & Dragons, and the gameplay is based on the rules of Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, which were released in 2000. It is the first video game to implement the real time application of the new rules. It is also the first game in the Baldur's Gate series released on consoles as opposed to a PC and/or Mac.Dark Alliance was well received on all four platforms, with the PlayStation 2 version going on to win the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award for \"Role-Playing Game of the Year\" (2001). A sequel, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, was released in 2004 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. A third game was planned, but was cancelled early in development due to legal problems."

Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat.Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world.Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries.Permadeath.

Each character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks.Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer.Diverse enemy roster.

A turn-based strategy game inspired by American football in the Warhammer fantasy world where elves, humans, orcs and other creatures fight for the ball with shoulder charges, kicks, punches and weapons of varying degrees of lethality (and legality by the ref).Your team, your call!As the coach, you must give instructions to your players: hinder the progress of your opponents by positioning them in your tackle zone, knock down those who get in your way, and break through to your opponents' end zone to score a touchdown!All your units can gain experience and receive statistic bonuses or new skills. However, be careful: injuries are common, especially when the referee is a goblin who tends to overlook most forms of violence. Some players may even leave the field limp and lifeless, putting an early and definitive end to their careers."

Bloodrayne Betrayal: Fresh Bites distills the best parts of the BloodRayne series into a bloody, twitchy, action-packed 2D hack ‘n slash adventure through fifteen challenging stages.The Brimstone Society has summoned Rayne for one last mission to lead a group of soldiers into a giant underground castle to do battle against her own father, Kagan. When the soldiers prove ineffective against Kagan’s supernatural menaces, it’s up to Rayne to run, jump, cut, and feed her way through gruesome foes, deadly traps, tricky platforming sections, and horrifying bosses. It’s Rayne’s last job — will she “clean house” or find herself six feet under?All-new A-List voice acting: Original BloodRayne cast members Laura Bailey and Troy Baker reprise their roles as Rayne and Kagan, alongside other talented voice actors who bring new life to the original written dialog.Sharpened visuals, squashed bugs, and support for higher display resolutions (up to 4K) help make Fresh Bites the definitive Bloodrayne Betrayal experience.New difficulty options: Play with a newly rebalanced difficulty tuned for a fun and engaging experience, or sink your teeth into the punishing original difficulty mode if you’re looking for a tough-as-nails challenge."

      "Infinite is an all-new lightning-fast fusion of the FPS and action genres, created by FYQD-Studio. Combine a wide variety of skills and abilities to unleash dazzling combo attacks.Bright Memory: Infinite is set in a sprawling, futuristic metropolis in the year 2036. A strange phenomenon for which scientists can find no explanation has occurred in the skies around the world. The Supernatural Science Research Organization (SRO) has sent agents out to various regions to investigate this phenomenon. It is soon discovered that these strange occurrences are connected to an archaic mystery – an as-of-yet unknown history of two worlds, about to come to light...About Bright Memory: Episode 1During the initial stages, since it was pretty difficult to estimate the number of copies that would sell, I decided to create the kind of game that could start out as a demo and later use crowdfunding support to develop further. I’ve finally managed to amass enough time and funding, so the action and general gameplay will remain as-is but the story and stages are all being reworked.From here on out, I will no longer be developing Bright Memory: Episode 1 any further, but I plan on making regular “experimental” additions of various new features, etc., which players will be able to try out. Once development of Bright Memory: Infinite is complete, it will be distributed as a separate game, but those who have already purchased Bright Memory: Episode 1 will receive a special “100% off” discount coupon for Bright Memory: Infinite prior to its release."

      "Welcome to Cannon Fodder 2. The hapless soldiers from the first game have been kidnapped by damn, dirty aliens, to see if they can save their own world from invasion. These aliens possess a time machine capable of transporting our not-quite-valiant troops to any period in human history, and they’re going to use it to test the chaps’ abilities in battle. Fortunately, for our boys in uniform, there’s an alien who sympathizes with their plight. He doesn’t agree with how the soldiers are treated and ensures that the ammo is plentiful. Only through the sheer will to live while remaining unventilated can our soldiers survive the grueling 72 stages and return to their own time, in one piece, mind you. Through five different time zones, they’ve got to battle against increasingly remote odds and kick their kidnapper’s butts. Only then can they retire to a place where the sun’s always shining and they serve drinks with those little umbrellas in them.Guide your stalwart troopers through time as they try to get through this war intact. Blending a perfect mix of action and small-scale strategy, Cannon Fodder 2 is simple yet very, very addictive. Capture vehicles such as the Choppa, the Jeep, and the Tank. Man any turrets you find while on the field of battle and turn the enemy’s weapons against them. Will you bring our boys back home? War and time travel have never been so much fun!Quick and furtive shooting action across a dangerous battlefield!Easy to learn, difficult to master gameplay will ensure that you’ll always have a challenge!"

Those who’ve faced its trials and tribulations before, can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance.In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One.With the summoning of The Old One, a colorless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them, lost their minds – left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained.Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight, are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title “Slayer of Demons” and send The Old One back to its slumber."

      "The third Diablo returns you to the world of Sanctuary, once again invaded by the demons. Twenty years after the ending of Diablo II, a star has fallen on the city of New Tristram, spawning hordes of undead monsters that the player must defeat. As usual in Diablo series, the game has a trademark dark fantasy atmosphere and is mostly set in gloomy dungeons.The basic gameplay features are the same as in previous Diablo games, but there are many subtle changes. The player can choose one of six character classes (a seventh is available with an expansion). Each class has its unique abilities and class-specific quests. Unlike its predecessors, which used isometric 2D graphics, Diablo III uses 3D, however, it preserves the familiar top-down view. The dungeons are randomly generated and have destructible environments, thanks to the new graphics engine. There’s a new mechanic Skill Runes that is used to improve the character’s skills.Online multiplayer is available through Battle.net. There are both a co-op mode and a PvP mode called Brawling. The players can create hardcore characters who face permadeath if killed. Even in the single-player mode, Diablo II requires a stable internet connection, because of DRM restrictions."

      "Enlisted - is an MMO squad based shooter which is built around some of the most important and famous episodes from World War 2.In Enlisted, players can experience these famous battles on a massive scale through the real heroes of those encounters - the soldiers. In some modes, players won’t be fighting alone on the battlefield, they will be leading their own squad of AI controlled soldiers, this will grant a unique scale to the combat. Engagements with up to hundreds of soldiers fighting simultaneously will be held on different fields of battle with maps up to hundreds of square kilometers.The latest version of the Dagor Engine is able to calculate huge detailed spaces, dynamic water and skies, while using physically based render.Teamplay, the correct evaluation of actions with consideration of the current situation on the battlefield, weapon and character capabilities - all of these will be essential parts of Enlisted. Players will gradually unlock new characters who will all have different playstyles. Additional diversity in the battles will also be granted by a wide weaponry selection. Just like in a real war, where you rarely can see two absolutely identical rifles - weapons in the Enlisted will have their own features and their own history.Popular World War II battles will be present in the Enlisted in separate campaigns. To re-create each of these battles requires not only the creation of separate content like new locations, characters, weapons and vehicles - it also requires a huge amount of work on creating the game rules and balance in them. This is why each campaign will be developed separately from each other."

      "■About the GameA group of children mysteriously disappeared during a festival on Rogetsu Isle. Although they were found, they had lost their memories. Now they have returned to the island as teenagers. The girls rely on the Camera Obscura, a camera with the power to capture and seal away unthinkable horrors, and the faint beam of their flashlight while exploring various locations and fending off the ghosts that attack them as they attempt to discover the truth of their haunting past.-Camera ObscuraThis is an old camera with the ability to repel vengeful ghosts and seal away their power by photographing them. As such, it is an indispensable item throughout the game. The Camera Obscura can be used as a weapon against ghosts by spotting them through the viewfinder and taking photos of them to inflict damage. It also plays a major role in the girls' investigation, as its special power allows them to see the keys that allow them to find their way through new areas.-Exploring Rogetsu IsleExplore the dimly lit Western-style mansions and abandoned hospitals on the island by relying on the moonlight and the faint beam of your flashlight. Progress the story by interacting with items and places that spark your interest. From past newspaper articles and notes, you uncover the vile secrets of the past, unravel the lost memories of the protagonist, and discover the truth.■Features-Improved GraphicsIn-game movies and character models have been improved to make the story and characters more appealing.

    "about": [
      "FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn is a massively multiplayer RPG developed by Square Enix. It is the direct continuation of FINAL FANTASY XIV.FFXIV: A Realm Reborn is a heavily updated version of the original FINAL FANTASY XIV with a different graphics engine, netcode, and storyline. The game was made because the game sold poorly and wasn't met with critical acclaim.PlotThe game takes place in  Eorzea five years after the events of the original game. FINAL FANTASY XIV ended on an apocalyptic note - a dragon god destroyed most of the Eorzea. Thanks to the blessing of the Gods, the player-created characters were able to escape certain death and were sent five years to the future. In a rebuilt world they face the danger of invasion by the Empire of the north.GameplayIn FFXIV, the players interact with each other in a world that continues to live on even without any players on the server. At the beginning of the game, the players are met by a character creation screen where they choose the name, race, gender, build, appearance and the base class. It is also necessary to choose a game world for your character. Players level up their characters by gaining EXP. EXP is gained by raiding dungeons, taking part in server-wide events, killing monsters, and completing quests.The game's combat system revolves around using a combination of character-specific weapon skills, the use of magic, and the physical attacks themselves."

      "First Class Trouble is an asymmetrical third person multiplayer co-operative game, about trust and deceit.With First Class Trouble we want to invoke a super strong social experience, filled with trust and deception. Players are working together, but a few players are not who they seem and are actively working against you. With First Class Trouble we want to create situations where you can never fully trust your companions, but you will have to trust someone in order to progress through the game. This means that you constantly have to look over your shoulder, uncover information on players and in the end, you will have to figure out who the Synth players are to win the game. We aim to create a rich playground of possibilities fueled by social interactions with other players. This will result in a new player experience each time you press “find a game”.The plotWe are on board the Alithea, a massive 2 km long space cruise ship, set for Proxima Centauri. Owned by the prominent Scandinavian Infinity Cruises, it is the most prestigious space project ever undertaken; a merger of wealth, power, and business in a newly technological world gone wild. Packed with all the latest tech, Alithea is also equipped with the latest in AI servants - Personoids. There had been some problem with maintaining the Personoids emotional state, but it had been solved before departure. The solutions were simply to reboot all the synths every 24 hours. But something failed – of course. Someone, or rather something in the system, didn’t reboot. Things spiraled out of control aboard the Alithea. Now it’s passing Jupiter at 1/8 the speed of light, with a robot rebellion. C.A.I.N. has already tried to eliminate all the passengers by turning the oxygen off, and only a couple of travelers with Oxygen Rebreathers are left - trying to escape. Luckily the Personoids, were purposely designed to be weaker than humans - because they are searching the ship for the last remaining humans. Hiding among them. Ready to finally ‘reset’ them for once.First Class Trouble varies from other titles with its engaging mix of cooperation and deception, using an in-depth proximity-based voice system, where players can communicate only when close to each other. It is through these close social interactions that intense and fun situations will arise."

When push comes to shove they will be there to lend a hand… or wing… or hoof!Platformer that makes sense: every prop on a level has a real-world reference - from desert quicksand to cutting-edge factory equipment.

      "HELLBOY WEB OF WYRD IS A 3RD PERSON ROGUELITE ACTION ADVENTURE WITH AN ORIGINAL STORY CREATED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DARK HORSE COMICS AND CREATOR MIKE MIGNOLA.Developed by Upstream Arcade, Hellboy Web of Wyrd is an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola. This roguelite action adventure game features monstrous toe-to-toe brawling. Like the comics, the game sends Hellboy on a series of vastly different and wholly unique adventures; and while those stories stand on their own, they are all tied to the mysterious legacy of The Butterfly House.Built in 1962 by occultist Pasquale Deneveaux, The Butterfly House is more than a mere residence; it’s a gateway. Its perverse angles and non-Euclidean geometries were designed with a singular foul purpose in mind: to open doorways into a terrible and fascinating dimension called The Wyrd.Twenty years later, an agent of the B.P.R.D. is sent on a reconnaissance mission to the mansion and promptly goes missing. It’s up to you - Hellboy - and your team of Bureau agents to find your missing colleague and uncover the secrets of The Butterfly House.During the investigation, you will explore wondrous and strange planes of existence contained within The Wyrd, each one home to powerful monsters, forgotten godforms, magnificent treasures, and powerful secrets. But be warned, because ancient evil stagnates within the furthest reaches of The Wyrd… evil that is eager to be let out.A graphical style that evokes the original art style of the comics and makes every moment of the game look - and feel - like it was ripped straight from the comic books.An unique roguelite Action Adventure with heavy-weight combat. Chain together hard-hitting melee and ranged attacks to fight a diverse array of increasingly nightmarish enemies.A narrative true to the spirit of the comics, tying together several independent stories into one unified Hellboy experience."

    "title": "Hellpoint",
    "about": [
      "Hellpoint is a dark sci fi action RPG set in the aftermath of a massive quantum cataclysm. Every living being quickly lost their mind as their memories and bodies were merged with alternate versions of themselves from parallel universes. The accident also attracted entities of immense power that should have been left alone, in the depth of other dimensions.You play as a mysterious nameless character whose intentions are entirely determined by your choices. You wake up in the derelict Irid Novo space station, in orbit around a super-massive black hole.In the game, the space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole. Its position in the sky directly impacts the sanity of the inhabitants of the station. The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.Hellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.In Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.Irid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.Hellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we've had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.For centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?Hellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.The more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.A terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...Every time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you."

      "Hindsight 20/20 - Wrath of the Raakshasa is a 3D third-person action RPG where players can fix mistakes from past playthroughs and relive them for vastly different gameplay and story experiences. Discover the power of morality in each journey where choices and actions have meaningful consequences.Hindsight 20/20 is founded on five pillars:1. Choice in Combat:Decide the fate of two kingdoms as one-armed warrior Jehan. Will he choose to respect the values of his former home by respecting life in all forms? Or will he choose the path of conflict and violence? Before every battle, make the conscious decision to wield a non-lethal stun rod to pacify enemies or a ruthless sword to put them down for good.2. A Malleable World:Champaner and its inhabitants switch between several states of disdain or acceptance for Jehan. Each playthrough shows only one version of the world as both the town and its inhabitants experience the effects of Jehan’s choices and actions.3. Interesting AI and Bosses:All NPCs react to the world Jehan shapes. Dialogue options and weapon choice are only two factors in how the AI behaves. Hindsight 20/20’s bosses exhibit emotion, making them more relatable. Nuances in their personality come to light as Jehan continues on his journey. The line between good and evil blurs as they react to Jehan.4. The Experience Engine:The Experience Engine is a hand-crafted, in-house gameplay engine driven by player choice. This engine is solely responsible for creating the dynamic gameplay and story experiences Jehan witnesses. Every action and choice made is observed and recorded by the Experience Engine leading to a high level of replayability. This feedback loop of choices, actions, and reactions affect the flow of the story and drives the gameplay of Hindsight 20/20.5. Ten different endings:Hindsight 20/20 has 10 different endings and four of those endings have absolutely no overlap. Each ending is carefully tailored to the choices and actions made in that journey. And unlocking each ending grants specific achievements as well."

    "about": [
      "​Insurmountable is an adventure roguelike with permadeath, in which the player has to overcome huge mountains. Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last.Choose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You'll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don't worry. As time goes by, you'll become stronger and stronger. Decide freely in a sophisticated skill system, which strengths should have yours climberin.In the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events.Three mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don't have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can't always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought.Face the challenge of ever new and changing dangers, face snowstorms and the sheer force of nature, always keep your eyes on the summit and overcome the insurmountable.Keyfeaturesno two climbs are alikeprocedurally generated mountainsdynamic world with different weather effectshundreds of events with ever-changing outcomesstrategic gameplay in path finding, stat and equipment management3 characters with different abilities"

    "about": [
      "Jumping Flash! is a first-person platform video game co-developed by Exact and Ultra and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The first installment in the Jumping Flash! series, it was first released for the PlayStation on 28 April 1995 in Japan, 29 September 1995 in Europe and 1 November 1995 in North America. It was re-released through the PlayStation Network store on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in 2007.Presented in a first-person perspective, the game follows a robotic rabbit named \"Robbit\" as he searches for missing jet pods scattered by the game's astrophysicist antagonist character Baron Aloha. Robbit must explore each section of Crater Planet to retrieve all of the jet pods, stop Aloha and save the world from being destroyed. The game was designed as a technology demonstrator for the PlayStation console and was revealed in early 1994 under the provisional title of \"Spring Man\". Jumping Flash! utilises much of the game engine used in Geograph Seal, an earlier game by Exact for the Sharp X68000 home computer.Jumping Flash! has been described as an ancestor of as well as an early showcase for 3D graphics in console gaming. It was generally well received by critics, who praised its graphics and unique 3D platforming gameplay, but it was eventually overshadowed by later 3D platformers of the fifth console generation. Jumping Flash! spawned two sequels: Jumping Flash! 2 and Robbit Mon Dieu. Despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews at the time of release, and even an appearance in Next Generation's \"Top 100 Games of All Time\" just one year after, the game was described as the third-most underrated video game of all time by Matt Casamassina of IGN in 2007. It also holds the Guinness World Record as the \"first platform video game in true 3D\"."

You both died – and yet, you both live.The Lady of the Lake, the ruler of the mystical island of Avalon brought you back to end a true nightmare. She wants you to go on a knightly quest. She wants you to finish what you have begun. Kill King Arthur – or whatever he has become after she took his dying vessel to Avalon..A Role-playing Tactical GameExperience a unique hybrid between turn-based tactical games and traditional, character-centric RPGs! This dark fantasy version of the Arthurian mythology invites you to manage a team of heroes on the dangerous battlefield, while also engaging in moral choices, hero management, and the rebuilding of Camelot.The dark fate of the kingdomExplore a land of nightmares where vile monsters and magical creatures lurk within castles and forests. The battle between Arthur and Mordred brought death, both of them falling at the hands of each other, and now the consequences unfold. Arthur, resurrected in Avalon, is now an undying mad king, his pain slowly turning this magical place into a nightmare version of Britannia. You are Mordred, brought back to life to find Arthur, and ultimately, kill him to end this accursed condition.The Round Table rebornGather your knights and send them on quests involving deep, tactical battles! Assemble a team of heroes, selecting from six classes (Defender, Champion, Marksman, Vanguard, Arcanist, Sage). Level them up, gain unique skill points, equip the best items looted from missions. But beware! Heroes can die, and the treatment of their injuries, curses, diseases take time. Between missions, make sure that Camelot has the right facilities for recovery, and prepare different heroes for different quests.A question of loyaltyHeroes are your main resources – but no mere numbers! They have their own distinct personalities, goals, rivalries (even unique traits, skills and bond benefits). They will observe your decisions closely! Settle disputes, grant favours, select heroes who can work together, send them on missions they are comfortable with. Tread carefully, because their loyalty depends on many factors. They can even leave and turn against you!The making of a monarchYou, as a king, have a personality as well, shaped by your actions and moral choices. The Morality Chart will represent your status between Christianity and Old Faith, between Tyranny and Righteousness. Your choices affect values on this chart, influencing both gameplay and narrative.The weight of decisionsEvery small decision matters – not only the moral choices, but actions taken in the turn-based combat as well. The campaign unfolds with a roguelite twist: no reloads, only regrets! The thrill of dealing with the consequences is half the fun, but your decisions also affect the story. Each playthrough can unfold differently, branching in unexpected ways.The end is only the beginningPlay through the campaign (once or see multiple paths), and after that, you unlock the endgame, reserved only for the bravest. Tough new challenges appear on the map with mythic bossfights, random quests, more loot and character progression ultimately leading to the banishing of Balor, the monstrous god-king of the Fomorians.At release, King Arthur: Knight's Tale will be available with English voice acting, with English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Hungarian text localization.

      "Offering a fresh take on the acclaimed fantasy series, King’s Bounty 2 expands upon its tactical turn-based battles to offer players a truly immersive RPG experience that adds weight to their every decision, whether leading an army into battle against unliving horrors, or building relations with local townsfolk. Experience a rich world that blends realism and fantasy, filled with compelling stories, memorable characters and moral choices aplenty!Taking on the mantle of one of three heroes – each with their own unique story – players embark on a non-linear, open-world adventure across a detailed and densely-packed fantasy landscape. Split into two distinct phases, players traverse the realm from a third-person perspective, picking up quests, exploring the wilderness, and getting to know the people they meet. When conflict arises, however, the perspective shifts to tactical, turn-based combat. Players must then make smart use of their units as they fight to win.Set in the vast realms of Antara, a great danger has arisen. A mysterious blight has descended upon its furthest reaches, corrupting the land and all who live there. Refugees from the affected regions have begun arriving in the kingdom of Nostria, putting food and resources in short supply. Once living souls, blight-distorted creatures now roam the countryside leaving chaos and destruction in their wake. The land itself fights for survival, giving your decisions greater weight than ever before. How will you forge Antara’s future?"

      "Labyrinth of Galleria: Coven of Dusk is the follow-up to Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk, which saw its English release in 2018. The Coven games are first-person dungeon crawlers in which the player creates a party of dolls, which can take on a variety of classes to confront enemies in a first-person combat style. We were pretty fond of both the storyline and gameplay of the original game, which broke into our top 5 best RPGs of 2018. In Labyrinth of Galleria, the player assumes the soul of the \"Necrolamp\", an item in the possession of Madam Malta that can explore dangerous labyrinths similar to the 'Tractatus de Monstrum' in the previous game. Malta's assistant (and the character in the key art) is Eureka, a girl who came to Galleria after looking at a recruitment poster for an exploration assistant."

They don't give a f*ck.I have to make this decision on my own, and very soon. Problem is, I don't know how.I've never been able to figure out why I do what I do. Not really.No more time to think. I have to go.Here’s the dealYou are Neil Conrad, CDI agent. Awoken by the news of a murder, you rush into a case that will soon turn your life and the whole solar system upside down. Ask questions, collect evidence, and put the pieces together until the ugly truth reveals itself... or not.No takebacksThe story branches and ends based on your actions. There's no going back. Sure, you can rush your way to the end – if you don't mind paying the price. Play your cards right, and you might make it out alive.How far will you go?Some questions don't have a right answer. Will you sell out a friend to protect your family? Will you endanger a loved one in exchange for public safety? Will you keep the peace or reveal the horrible, world-shattering truth?Hungry for Point & Click Adventure?While the classics were great in their time, Lacuna does away with the baggage of many adventure game tropes:Pointing & clicking Platformer movement controls (WASD / controller)Selecting all dialog options one by one anyway Non-repeating conversations and choicesInventory management and counter-intuitive puzzles Immersive, story-driven mysteriesPixel hunting Optional outlines on anything interactableStory grinds to a halt at every puzzle can always be driven forward\"x will remember this\" Real choices and multiple endings"

Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room.His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further.How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice?"

By the time the game begins, Peter has captured the infamous Kingpin as well as several other supervillains. Now, a gang that goes by the name of Demons poses a new danger to New York. Meanwhile, Peter is working for the scientist Otto Octavius, who didn't yet become Dr. Octopus, on their science project. Throughout the game, Spidey has to deal with multiple enemies, such as Norman Osbourne, Electro, Vulture, Rhino and Kingpin, among others.GameplayThe player controls Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, from the third person view. There are also sections of the game in which the player controls other protagonists, namely Mary Jane and Miles Morales. The game is set in a 3D environment that is modeled after New York City. The player can travel the city using web slings, running, jumping, and crawling the walls. The setting includes numerous high-rise buildings designed specifically for Spider-Man's movements.As the player progresses, he or she unlocks new suits that grant Spider-Man new abilities, such as additional attacks or enhanced Spider-Sense. The abilities are not tied to the suits, however, and the player can use the suit of his or her choice without losing the ability. The combat system is similar to that in Batman: Arkham, in that Spider-Man fights many opponents in hand-to-hand combat but avoids killing them."

      "Quill is back! In Moss: Book II, the story picks up right where things left off following the successful rescue of Quill’s uncle Argus. Your adventure continues with the revelation that a winged tyrant leading the Arcane forces has turned its focus on Quill and is now on the hunt for her within the hexed castle where her uncle was held captive. Lined with dangerous terrain, challenging puzzles, and enemies twisted in fire and steel, Quill’s journey will be trying—filled with triumph and heartbreak alike—but new allies, old friends, and the very nature of the castle itself can help as she works to save the world from a great unmaking."

    "about": [
      "The horns sound, the ravens gather. An empire is torn by civil war. Beyond its borders, new kingdoms rise. Gird on your sword, don your armour, summon your followers and ride forth to win glory on the battlefields of Calradia. Establish your hegemony and create a new world out of the ashes of the old.Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is the eagerly awaited sequel to the acclaimed medieval combat simulator and role-playing game Mount & Blade: Warband. Set 200 years before, it expands both the detailed fighting system and the world of Calradia. Bombard mountain fastnesses with siege engines, establish secret criminal empires in the back alleys of cities, or charge into the thick of chaotic battles in your quest for power.SIEGE GAMEPLAYConstruct, position and fire a range of heavy machinery in sieges that will test your wits and skill like never before. Experience epic, sprawling combat across ramparts and rubble as you desperately hold on to your castle or seek to seize one from the enemy.Historically authentic defensive structures offer the ultimate medieval warfare experience, as you batter a rival's gate with your ram or burn his siege tower to ashes. Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord lets you live every moment of a chaotic battle through the eyes of a single soldier.DIPLOMACYEngage in diplomacy, with meaningful consequences that impact the world. Strike historic peace deals that win land for your kingdom or free you to take on a new foe. An all-new barter system gives players flexibility in cementing deals, from marriage offers to treason pacts, offering all the options available to NPCs. Use a new influence system to direct your faction's energies or strangle the aspirations of a rival.SANDBOX ECONOMYSee the availability of goods ebb and flow in a simulated feudal economy, where the price of everything from incense to warhorses fluctuates with supply and demand. Invest in farms and workshops, or turn anarchy to your advantage by being the first to bring grain to a starving town after a siege or reopening a bandit-plagued caravan route.CRAFTINGCraft your own weapon, name it and carry it with you to the field of battle! A deep, physics-based system gives each weapon you create a unique set of attributes, strengths and weaknesses. Forge a finely-tuned killing machine to match your own prowess and complement your play-style, or take the sword of your enemy and brandish it as a trophy of war.MODDINGThe engine and tools used to develop Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord are being made available to the community, so that modders can re-interpret Calradia or create their own worlds! Players can now combine different mods, making it easier than ever to play the game of your dreams.ENGINEAn all-new tailor-made game engine, developed in-house to fulfill the unique needs of the series, offers the perfect balance of performance and graphical fidelity, scalable with the power of your hardware.Experience Mount & Blade with richer, more beautiful graphics than ever, immersing you in the world of Calradia, rendering the game's magnificent battles with equally spectacular detail."

      "No Man's Sky is a space action-adventure survival game developed by Hello Games.The overall visual style of the game is inspired by various science fiction books. Demoscene also served as a source of inspiration for the developers.The main feature that the game revolves around is the procedural generation. Each planet you visit is generated from scratch. The information about the planets and their inhabitants is dynamically updated so every player can discover a new species or planet and give it a name.No Man's Sky gameplay implies the exploration of space and planets some of which are inhabited with extra-terrestrial life, gathering resources, space battles, maintaining and upgrading the player's ship and completing bounty hunting missions. The main objective is to reach the center of the galaxy. On release, it was stated that the game is in fact multiplayer, but the size of its world is so big that the probability of meeting another player is extremely small. It turned out that it is impossible to meet any other player due to the extremely limited multiplayer aspect. As of 2018, Hello Games released the fourth major update which included the full multiplayer experience."

As word of his death echoes throughout the kingdom, the crown passes to his arrogant, yet untested son Magnus.Even worse, the Pestilence, an unholy plague not seen for a thousand years, has returned. It sweeps across the land, corrupting everything and everyone it touches. Madrigal Seline, a ruthlessly ambitious figure in the church, sees the Pestilence as a chance to prove herself in the eyes of her god.These forces converge on the backwater Isola Sacra, where rebel groups and the provincial government fight for control amid the isle’s crumbling ruins.You are a Cerim – a member of a group of mystical holy warriors imbued with remarkable powers and sworn to defeat the Pestilence at any cost. But the task will prove increasingly challenging as you become entangled in the people’s plight and the vast political struggle of this downtrodden land. Chaos will pull you in every direction as you seek to cleanse the land of wickedness and shape the kingdom’s fate."

      "Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee is the first chapter of the Oddworld franchise. The game is set in the fictional Oddworld universe inhabited by extraterrestrials. The story follows Abe, a slave on the Mudokon meat factory, who suddenly realizes the perspective of being slaughtered in the near future with all of his fellow slaves. Players are offered to take control of Abe on his way to the liberation of the rest of enslaved Mudokons. The gameplay features classic platformers’ mechanics: all the action is divided into 2D levels that should be passed. In the course of the completion, Abe is going to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and defeat (or dodge) enemies. Each players’ mistake from failing a grenade throw to falling from high ground will cause death and a restart of the level from the last checkpoint, which means difficulties. On the way through the Oddworld Abe can use his supernatural ability to telepathically influence Sligs (unplayable characters). However, their help is only available in safe areas, so the Mudokons’ rescue is though up to Abe."

However, few have ever returned from Kisejima alive.■Characters: Kuuta, a demon warrior, and his spirit partner, KazemaruKuuta, the protagonist, is the only survivor of the Demon King's army that faced Momotaro in battle. He and Kazemaru, a mysterious spirit that lives on Kisejima, team up to take on challenges of all shapes and sizes!■Artwork by KENEI DESIGNKisejima may not be large, but the colorful artwork by KENEI DESIGN, with its dazzling green meadows, looming forests, and plains of floating megaliths, offers a unique emotional impact unlike any other action game.

      "An island outside of reality. A rogue human civilization hoping to resurrect dead alien gods. A murder behind locked doors.Paradise is an island that regenerates every few millennia. The psychic power that the alien worshipers within release into the universe is meant to feed and eventually resurrect their fallen deities. But this force also attracts undesired interest from demons, who eventually corrupt each island — until a new alternate reality is birthed by the Council.The system isn’t perfect, but it will be one day — on Perfect 25, the next island-to-be. But on the eve of rebirth, the Council is murdered and Paradise is killed.In the aftermath, the “investigation freak” Lady Love Dies is summoned from exile to find the culprit. This is the crime to end all crimes.What are the facts? What are the truths? Are they the same?You are tasked with finding the killer and building an airtight case against them. Take your case to trial and argue your interpretation of the evidence. Only when someone is successfully convicted can the crime be considered solved and Paradise be saved.The “truth” is that there are many possible killers, and many ways to build a case. Even if you make a convincing case for prosecution and get someone convicted, is the mystery really solved?Paradise is an island set in an alternate future history filled with cryptic lore and even more mysteries. Examine bizarre relics to learn more about this world’s surreal history.You choose who to accuse, and build a case to support conviction. Everyone on Paradise has a secret to hide and something to gain. Old friends become new suspects, forcing you to choose between the evidence, the greater good and your own beliefs. There are many possible murderers, but who you pick will define your own personal truth.Let your personal computer and electronic assistant Starlight be your guide through another dance of an investigation. Collect evidence, record testimony and interpret the facts to form your own truth.Solve hieroglyph puzzles on ancient nightmare computers to discover new areas of the island, find concealed evidence and reveal terrifying secrets."

      "The town of Moonbury has always been wary of the advances of the outside world, preferring to rely on their traditional methods of healing. Until one day, when the mayor's daughter falls ill, and the local witch doctor can do nothing to help her, they are forced to look outside their small community for help.The Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG.FeaturesTake care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed.Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you&#39;ll just need to craft some Minty Goblet.Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you&#39;ve decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert.Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won&#39;t be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you&#39;ll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you&#39;re a chemist, you&#39;ll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you.Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies.Build relationships with the townsfolk. It&#39;ll take a little while, but your patients&#39; health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they&#39;ll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes.Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating allowing you to improve the area by improving public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch!Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community&#39;s ailments, you&#39;ll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. You are free to go at your own pace and take it easy.Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn&#39;t relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day."

      "Praey for the Gods is a boss climbing open world adventure game where you play as a lone hero sent to the edge of a dying frozen world to discover the mystery behind a never-ending winter. Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to.<h3>Scale Massive Beasts</h3><br/>Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land.<h3>Climb, Glide, Swim</h3><br/>You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don't stay in too long or your swim could become your last.<h3>Explore, Craft, and Survive</h3><br/>You'll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it's up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn't the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait.<h3>Make Your Path</h3><br/>Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course.<h3>Unravel the Mystery</h3><br/>Why won't the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to.<h3>A Beautifully Frigid World</h3><br/>Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don't let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.<h3>About the Development Team</h3><br/><br/><br/>Praey for the Gods is being created by No Matter Studios a tiny studio of 3. Brian Parnell, Tim Wiese (glasses) and Hung-Chien Liao.  In 2014, the friends began working after-hours on their first game. By January 2016, they had enough confidence in their progress to leave game-studio jobs in San Francisco and move to Seattle. Working in Parnell’s basement, they pursued an all-or-nothing dream to make the game of their dreams."

    "about": [
      "The rootsOne of the classic representatives of the first-person shooter genre. Designed and released in 1996 by the authors of the groundbreaking game Doom - iD Software. This is the first game to start the still ongoing series. Unlike its famous predecessor, the game uses an engine capable of rendering full-fledged 3D: the game supports an earlier version of 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After moving to a new engine, the game needed a new control scheme: the movement is now possible in all three directions, including the vertical axis. This feature added to the game an additional difficulty: player have to expect the enemy attack from any direction. The game also has a full-fledged multiplayer, the previous version of which the Doom players liked.Key featuresIn a single player campaign, the player takes control of the main character named Ranger, who went to the portal in order to stop the unknown enemies, code-named Quake. The plot of the adventure consists of 32 separate levels. Six more maps are available in multiplayer for the battles between the players for deathmatch mayhem. Two mission packs were released for the game, which adds new enemies, new levels, new maps, new weapons and a new experience for players to the original game. Both packs were greatly received by both players and critics."

      "Resident Evil 2 is the remake of the 1998 game of the same name. PlotThe plot of the remake is identical to that of the original game. The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.GameplayThe player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists' storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character's POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.Changes from the originalBesides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player's character rather than the camera. The remake uses an over the shoulder camera, and the movements are relative to its angle. There's also no more loading screens, and the characters move between locations seamlessly."

      "The first motorbike simulation that combines a realistic racing challenge with engineering and mechanics! Ride the world's most powerful motorbikes and optimise their performance by swapping out parts and analysing data in real time.A race is not won purely on the track, so you need to become more than a rider by understanding motorbike behaviour like a real engineer. Traction, angle, braking, torque, trajectory, speed… every factor must be considered before heading to the workshop to change certain components and configuring the optimal set-up.A DREAM GARAGEYour adventure starts by choosing your dream motorbike. In RiMS Racing, you can ride the world's 8 most powerful European and Japanese motorbikes: Ducati Panigale V4 R, MV Agusta F4 RC, Aprilia RSV4, BMW M 1000 RR, Suzuki GSX-R1000R, Honda CBR1000RR, Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10RR, Yamaha YZF-R1. Recreated with an unmatched level of detail thanks to close collaboration with each manufacturer, these motorbikes also provide a highly accurate and realistic riding experience. They are true rough diamonds that only need a few cuts to shine their brightest!OPTIMISE YOUR MOTORBIKEWith a mechanics management system never before seen in a motorbike simulation, you can dismantle all your bike's parts to maintain them after each race or to upgrade them and boost your performance. You will become familiar with every last screw in your motorbike. Browse a catalogue of over 500 official spare parts from the biggest names in the industry along with over 200 official equipment items to personalise your rider!ANALYSE YOUR PERFORMANCERiMS Racing thrusts you straight into the heart of the action with the Motorbike Status Check (MSC), which helps you analyse your bike's behaviour in real time and understand how to optimise your performance. Brake disc temperature, tyre compound and pressure pressure, suspension behaviour affecting stability, electronic settings… Just like for a real rider, your motorbike's configuration can be adapted to your riding style!ACCURATE AND REALISTIC PHYSICSThe level of accuracy and details provided by the mechanics management and MSC is matched by realistic motorbike physics that will thrill the most demanding of track racers. But thanks to the various ride assist technologies, less experienced players can still learn the techniques that will take them to the top.THE MOST ICONIC CIRCUITSSilverstone, Laguna Seca, Suzuka, Nürburgring, Paul Ricard… Travel the world and enjoy thrilling races on 10 faithfully recreated official circuits. For those who prefer roads, five routes in the stunning landscapes of the United States, Norway, Australia, Spain and Italy have been recreated for a different racing experience on two wheels!MANAGE YOUR CAREER AND TEAMCareer mode in RiMS Racing gives you control of a team. Build your rider by managing their race calendar, choose which R&D areas to invest in, and upgrade the team's skills. If you make the right decisions and improve your racing performances, opportunities with other manufacturers will become available to you!"

This time, you weren’t born to be a mighty knight and you won’t become the king after killing a dragon.You’re just a medieval thug, a simple criminal who’s trying to get rich and not killed in the meantime. Easy to say, harder to do - especially when you’re on the rock-bottom of feudal social ladder. But who said you need to obey the law? Throw a knight off his horse, lose the chase and roam around the castle town like a boss.Every choice has its consequences… but not here!Enjoy your freedom in an open-world, medieval-inspired setting. You won’t find here either historical, or political correctness. Prepare yourself for wild, over-the-top action and parody of RPG cliches. Take a job from one of various fractions: spoiled priests, exploitative merchants, corrupted city guards or boorish villagers. Or... just give up the plot like you always do and make some mess in the city using melee and ranged weapons.Different times, same sh… styleExperience old school, skill-based combat in fast-paced gameplay. Fight on foot or hop on one of the mounts (like horses or wagons). Slash your enemies with a sword, impale them upon your spear... or just use a simple pitchfork if you don’t have any fancy weapons. Take them down from distance with a bow or crossbow.Friends? I don’t know those peasants…Play the online multiplayer mode, classic way: grab a few friends, choose the map, game mode (deathmatch, CTF, jousting tournament or race) and play! No XPs, loot boxes, and skins - just pure rampage!"

      "Ogasawara Hiroki is a thoroughly average man. A photographer by trade, he works long and demanding hours every day, all the while overseen by his tyrannical boss.Living in the middle of Tokyo on a paltry salary, Hiroki resides in a small, run-down apartment, and eats instant noodles to survive.His life can hardly be called ‘glamorous’…Until one day, that is, when he’s tasked with taking photos of Japan’s top idol, Ikue Ayu.One thing leads to another, and Hiroki soon finds himself at the mercy of three beautiful women – all of them celebrities. There’s the cute idol Ayu, the sultry businesswoman Marina, and the airheaded social media star Cosmos. They’re all rich, famous, and extremely well-endowed, and they should be utterly unattainable…But, for some reason, they’re insatiably attracted to Hiroki!According to Marina, these three women are all succubi, and they find Hiroki’s scent intoxicating. They can’t get enough of him – and soon, Hiroki’s average life becomes anything but.Ayu is a super famous idol whose name is known across Japan. She’s revered for her cute stage persona and her seemingly humble nature. During her concerts, she never fails to thank her fans, and her enthusiasm is contagious!...That’s just how it appears, however. Deep down, Ayu is a scheming vixen who regards her fans as mere stepping stones, and values money above all else. She’s so avaricious, she claims to be ‘moneysexual’, and she spurns the advances of men…At least, she did, until she met Hiroki.Marina is a wealthy businesswoman who owns a well-known clothing company. Though she’s only thirty-one, she’s one of the richest women in Japan, and she’s respected by men and woman more than twice her age.Marina is a coolly confident beauty. She isn’t the sort to fluster easily, and she has no qualms about taking whatever she wants. She’s domineering, with a sadistic streak, but she has a motherly side, and she’s good at dispensing advice.Cosmos is a popular social media star, with over three million followers on RapidPound. Cosmos shot to stardom after posting a series of semi-nude photos of herself online, which went viral. Since then, she’s been revered as the sexiest, most daring RapidPounder of all time.Though Cosmos dresses and acts in a provocative manner, this isn’t entirely intentional. At heart, she’s a naïve girl, with no genuine understanding of the effect her half-naked body elicits in the opposite (and, in some cases, same) sex. This often gets her in trouble, though she can’t fathom why.Cosmos is known for lewd photos, but she’s a sweetheart who believes in true love. She dreams of one day meeting a handsome prince who’ll sweep her off her feet."

    "about": [
      "Ogasawara Hiroki was once an ordinary man, but his life has now taken a distinctly unordinary turn. Quite unwittingly, he stumbled upon a well-kept secret which flipped his humdrum existence upside-down: namely, that several of Japan's most famous female celebrities are succubi.These succubi fall for Hiroki in droves, and soon he obtains quite the harem. His gaggle of adoring succubi include the two-faced idol, Ikue Ayu; the ditzy social media star, Cosmos; the sadistic businesswoman, Marina; the elegant actress, Hifumi; the cheerful tennis player, Hazel; and the aloof succubus princess, Yue.After narrowly escaping a lifetime of imprisonment in the succubus realm, Hiroki is ready to kick back and relax. Ayu invites him on a vacation to her private beach house in Okinawa, and Hiroki is happy to refuse. The other succubi come along for the ride, and a week of summertime fun begins.Join Hiroki as he breaks up vicious pillow fights, teaches Cosmos how to swim, and (begrudgingly) goes jogging with Hazel, all the while deepening his bonds with his adoring harem.Ayu is a famous idol beloved by men and women alike across Japan. Her songs are peppy and adorable; her stage outfits pink and frilly; her attitude sweet and innocent.That's the image she wants to project... but, in actuality, the real Ayu is quite different. She's cold and calculating, and some of her more disdainful expressions could curdle milk.She is very fond of Hiroki despite herself, however, and she's slowly becoming more honest with her feelings towards him.Marina is a wealthy businesswoman who owns her own company. She is one of the oldest of Hiroki's harem, and tries to act like a mature big sister should. She is generally calm and level-headed, but she's highly sensitive about her age - a fact which Ayu mocks mercilessly.Marina might act commandeering, but she has a soft side she only shows to those she loves. Away from the office and on the beach, Marina is more willing than she otherwise would be to let her hair down, and show Hiroki how cute she can really be.Cosmos is a social media star with a highly successful RapidPound account, which boasts over three million followers. Cosmos makes a living taking spicy photos of herself for her ever-growing audience, in a variety of costumes and poses.Cosmos loves her fans dearly, but she loves Hiroki even more. She's eager to please, and willing to do anything to make Hiroki happy...But, since she's an airhead, she sometimes takes things a bit too far.Hifumi is a well-regarded actress who has been working in the movie industry for over a decade. She's so popular, even Hiroki's father is a big fan of hers.Hifumi is an elegant, demure woman, who typically wears luxurious kimonos. On the beach, however, she prefers to dress more casually, in a baggy shirt and shorts. This is a side of Hifumi that her fans have never seen before, and it's all for Hiroki's sake.She might have changed up her look, but Hifumi is just as doting as ever, and she dreams of one day being Hiroki's wife.Hazel is a tennis star with a Japanese mother and an American father. She's unfailingly cheerful and upbeat, and is rarely seen without a big smile. She loves exercising, and is determined to get Hiroki to join her on her early morning jogs, even if it kills him.Hazel has a penchant for both pretty women and handsome men. She's very fond of Lady Yue, but she's just as fond of Hiroki. Unable to choose between them, Hazel has, instead, opted to love them both equally.Yue is the princess of the succubus realm. She may appear cool and aloof, but she has thawed out somewhat following the events of Sakura Succubus #3.Yue has spent most of the life in the succubus realm, governing he people. As such, she has few opportunities to enjoy the human world. She's determined to have some fun during the summer - and of course, she wants Hiroki to compliment her on her swimsuit."

      "Promising the Sabotage touch in every system, Sea of Stars aims to modernize the classic RPG in terms of turn-based combat, storytelling, exploration and interactions with the environment, while still offering a hearty slice of nostalgia and good old, simple fun.Key ingredientsEngaging turn-based combat - Combat gameplay includes active player input during attack animations (timed hits), multi-character combo attacks, boosting, and strategic defense options to hinder enemies while they are channeling a powerful attack or spell. For a more immersive experience, there are no random encounters or transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding. Both navigation and combat happen in the same environment.Unshackled traversal -  Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you run through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tileset movement.Prequel story set in The Messenger’s universe - Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you’d expect from a Sabotage production.Full-on dynamic lighting - Our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.The Sabotage treatment on the turn-based RPG genre - Every system has been deeply analyzed to create an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while reworking some elements to offer a modernized experience free of irritants and timesinks."

    "about": [
      "His legend begins with you!Before he was the world’s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth.As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be.KEY PILLARS:The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you’re living it.Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace.And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean.A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?A Darkening Tide: A vibrant open-world island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become."

In order to survive in this ruthless ocean, you will have to ally with other pirate captains to form the most influential pirate gang, becoming too big to fail and joining the endless struggle for supremacy of the Indian Ocean.FROM UPSTART PIRATE CAPTAIN TO LEADER OF YOUR OWN GANGChoose your own pirate captain and grow into the fierce legend that you have always wanted to be. Select your pirate ship class based on your preferred playstyle, evolving it with a rich RPG system.

      "The game is set in the Star Wars universe during the Old Republic era. The player assumes the role of a Republic commando who leads his group of four Clone troopers, the Delta Squad, through various military missions. You only directly control the commander of the squad, Delta-38 aka Boss, the other three characters are AI-controlled NPCs that you can give orders to. They are known only by their codenames and have different specializations: Sev is a sniper, Fixer is a technician, and Scorch is explosives expert. The player is not fully identified with the main character, and if Boss is shot down, the player can order his comrades to revive him or to continue on with the mission. The level is only considered failed if the whole Delta Squad is down.The plot revolves around the Clone Wars that was fought between movie Episodes II and III. The Delta Squad fights against the Separatist forces on the various planets, among them Geonosis and the Wookie homeland Kashyyk. A few classic Star Wars characters make appearances, most prominently, General Grievous as a boss and Master Yoda at a mission briefing. The game’s soundtrack contains the excerpts from the Star Wars film score, some original music, and a song by Indie Rock band Ash."

      "Subnautica is a first-person game about survival in the deep sea. You control Ryley Robinson, a space traveler in the 22nd century, who crash-landed his starship on a planet that is covered almost entirely by the ocean. The protagonist needs to eat and drink, although this can be disabled in lower difficulty modes. He can desalinate oceanic water, catch or gather the seafood, and create useful tools and structures. Unlike many survival games, Subnautica has a detailed plot, in which Ryley has to uncover why his ship crashed. By exploring the ocean, finding the remnants of other crashes, and listening to the radio messages, Robinson will learn about the enormous Leviathan, the mysterious Precursors, and the reason why this planet is quarantined.The game is famous for its spectacular portrayal of the ocean and its wildlife. Robinson is equipped with a scuba diving gear that allows the player to spend most of the game underwater, although oxygen still has to be replenished. The player can dive deep and explore the world full of corals, fish, and other colorful sea creatures, often grotesque or bio-luminescent. The environment is randomly generated to improve replayability."

      "Super Perils of Baking is a ground-up remake of Lillymo Games’ very first title, 2018’s 2D platformer Perils of Baking. In Super Perils of Baking, players take control of a talented student-baker who has but one goal in mind: Stopping his brother -- enchanted by a cursed baking hat garnered from their school's basement -- from wreaking havoc throughout the land.Written entirely in verse with a storybook-like presentation, Super Perils of Baking spans 50 core levels and totes plenty of secrets, too. With concise 2D platforming, balanced difficulty, beautiful pixel art, a fun soundtrack, and tons to unlock (including new playable characters). Lillymo’s newest offering is made for audiences young and old (and is especially cute for adults to play with their children).Whether on foot, hurtling in a minecart, swimming underwater, holding onto a balloon, or altering gravity and quite literally turning things upside down, Super Perils of Baking is a food fight for everyone... and True Bakers will find New Game, Trophies and Achievements, and tons of collectibles to keep them busy post-adventure, too."

      "After two decades, Nightdive Studios is rebooting and re-imagining the original System Shock. We will keep the new game true to the classic experience, keeping all the things you loved while giving today's gamers the modern look and feel expected from a AAA title.Help fund this game!With the help of members of the original team, including the original Voice Actor of SHODAN, Terri Brosius, Citadel Station has never been more immersive or terrifying!“When you’re working on a game, you tend not to think about how people will feel about it 20 years later – or if people will even remember it! The announcement of the System Shock update from Nightdive (and the upcoming System Shock 3 I’m working on) it’s apparent that not only do people remember, they care very deeply about the game. Back when we were working on the original, we wanted to make a simulation-based game that would empower players to tell their own stories through their playstyle choices – an idea that’s still totally relevant today. I’ve long said that if you updated the graphics, sound and UI on System Shock you’d have something that competes directly with any game on the market today. Now the Nightdive folks are doing that update and I’m confident my prediction will be validated. SHODAN demands that you support this so we can all find out.” --Warren Spector, OtherSide Entertainment. Producer on the original System Shock.You're a renowned hacker, the most notorious cyberspace thief in the corporate world. Caught during a risky break-in, you become indentured to a greedy TriOptimum executive. After six months in a healing coma, you awaken to the twisted aftermath of a terrible disaster. Where are the surgeons? Why is the station in such disrepair? Slowly, the chilling realization that something is very wrong creeps over you. Once a prime corporate research facility, Citadel Station now teems with mindless cyborgs, robots and terribly mutated beings, all programmed to serve SHODAN, a ruthless A.I. There's scarcely time to think before it unleashes the first terror...“The crew at Nightdive heroically brought the original versions of System Shock and System Shock 2 back into circulation. They have thrived as a new audience has rediscovered these classics.  Now Nightdive is remastering the original System Shock to bring it up to date on modern PC’s - with fully updated visuals, audio and a modern interface – making it dramatically more accessible to modern gamers.  It’s quite wonderful to see a franchise that Warren and I helped create get such loving care.\" --Paul Neurath, Founder of OtherSide Entertainment. Co-founder of Looking Glass Studios."

    "about": [
      "Based on the 2010 release, the game features improved graphics and sound, as well as updated game design, bringing to life a new Tactics Ogre that remains true to its roots. Tactics Ogre veterans will experience a game that surpasses their fondest memories, while players new to Tactics Ogre will discover a game unlike any they've ever played. Reborn and deeper than ever, the game enables players to immerse themselves in the world and intrigue of Tactics Ogre like never before.The StoryThe Valerian Isles, jewels of the Obero Sea. Long a center of naval commerce, the people of the isles struggled throughout history for dominion over her shores.Finally there rose a man to put an end to this conflict: Dorgalua Oberyth. But history would know him as the \"Dynast-King.\" King Dorgalua strove to stamp out the hatred among the people of the isles, and for fully half a century, Valeria knew prosperity.Yet upon the king's death, civil war erupted anew as three factions vied for control: the Bakram, who comprised much of Valeria's nobility; the Galgastani, whose people made up the majority of the isles' population; and the Walister, who numbered but few.The isles were soon divided between the Bakram and Galgastani, and an uneasy peace settled across the land. Yet none believed the calm would last...Tactics Ogre: Reborn FeaturesYour choices affect how the story unfolds, and even how it ends, with a game system that allows for multiple paths through the game and multiple endings. The story takes place through the eyes of a young man named Denam. The decisions he makes will alter the fate of those around him, and shift the course of Valeria's history.Fight pitched tactical battles on three-dimensional battlefields. The completely revamped AI enables enemies to adapt their tactics to the situation, providing a battle system that always keeps you thinking and never grows old.The class-wide level management system used in Tactics Ogre (2010) has changed to a unit-by-unit level system. Theorycraft your way through endless combinations of classes, equipment, skills, and magic.Enjoy numerous playability improvements, such as a quicker pace of battle, auto save, and a complete overhaul to the controls and UI to make it easier to get into the game than ever.The unparalleled details of the characters and backgrounds from the original Tactics Ogre (1995) have been recreated in high definition, while the detailed pixel art that gives the game its unique feel has been preserved and enhanced.The cutscenes are fully voiced in English and Japanese, and all of the music has been rerecorded with live performances! The voices bring new life to the complex motivations of the characters that make up the factions and shifting political alliances of this epic story.When you advance far enough in the game you'll unlock the World Tarot, enabling you to travel back in the story with the power of your forces intact; an incredibly useful feature in a game where your choices have such a huge impact on how the story unfolds. If you wonder what a different choice would have led to, now you can find out!Traveling back isn't limited to the story; the Chariot Tarot lets you rewind up to a certain number of moves during battle. In a game of tactical battles where a single mistake can mean the difference between victory and defeat, you can play without worrying that you'll back yourself into a corner.Enjoy a wealth of endgame content such as the 100-level Palace of the Dead. A world of endless stories and intrigue awaits!"

      "Two stories, two main characters, one epic experience: in Memoria, players travel through different time periods, while following two distinct protagonists: Sadja, a southern princess who wants to be a war hero, and Geron, a bird catcher who wants to lift a curse from his girlfriend. The game combines point & click gameplay with unique magic skills.Sadja, a Southern princess, has an unstoppable desire to become the greatest hero in history – by joining and succeeding in the biggest war Aventuria has ever seen: The war of the Mages, fought in the middle of an uninhabitable desert.Bird catcher Geron lives almost 450 years after the Great War. Geron’s eternal love, Nuri, has been turned into a crow by an evil curse. To give her back her human form, Geron needs the help of the mysterious merchant Fahi, who has magical powers. But Fahi is only willing to help Geron if he agrees to solve a puzzle which Fahi has seen in his dreams. The quest for answers soon leads to a chain of events that connects both Sadja's and Geron's stories, threatening to turn the present into a grim reflection of a long forgotten past.Memoria combines classic point & click adventure gameplay with the features of The Dark Eye, one of the most successful RPG universes known in the fantasy world. Point & click adventure game puzzles get a unique twist by adding magical features – and a wise, talking staff. Over eight chapters, players control both Sadja’s and Geron’s fates, involuntarily interacting with each other and bridging over 500 years of time. Each chapter in Memoria features opulent graphics, epic locations, a thrilling fantasy crime story and a unique puzzle design that differs from chapter to chapter."

      "In The Eternal Cylinder, players control a herd of adorable creatures called Trebhums and must explore a strange alien world filled with exotic lifeforms, surreal environments, and the constant threat of the Cylinder, a gargantuan rolling structure of ancient origin which crushes everything in its path. This unique ecosystem is a massive, procedurally generated land with unique animal AI, real-time world destruction, and organic exploration and puzzle design to create emergent gameplay that ensures no two playthroughs are ever the same.Your Trebhums begin at the bottom of the natural food chain but can mutate and evolve with new physical attributes and abilities by eating a variety of flora and fauna. Discover and adapt dozens of mutations, including new traversal skills like flying and swimming to reach new areas, and new senses to help overcome puzzles, challenges and dangers. Your many Trebhums can each have different mutations, and new mutations don’t replace ones you already have, letting you stack ability sets in dynamic ways. Each mutation will also change the physical look of a Trebhum and stacking these will generate near countless surprising new creature designs which players will be able to organically discover as they explore this unique alien ecosystem."

The game retains most of the original mod's lore, but reimagines the characters and the setting and features a completely new voice acting and a music score. The game is powered by Unreal Engine.PlotThe game is set in a mythological ancient Roman city somewhere deep underground. A group of 26 archeologists explored the city until one of them accidentally broke a taboo and activated an ancient curse. Now they are trapped in a time loop and cursed to die and relive their deaths forever. That is, unless one of them changes what happened to the city and its inhabitants long ago, thus preventing the curse.  In the ruins, there's a portal, which leads to the past and allows the characters to relive and alter the previous events in the vein of The Groundhog Day movie. The Forgotten City features branching non-linear plots with difficult moral dilemmas and plot twists. There are multiple endings that depend on the player's actions.GameplayThe player controls a protagonist that is fully customizable, up to his or her sex and physical appearance, in a 3D ancient city. Compared to the original mod, the game introduces new combat mechanics and wall climbing. However, most of the gameplay is based around characters' interactions and timeline manipulations."

      "The Last of Us Part II is the sequel to the post-apocalyptic zombie game The Last of Us.PlotThe game follows Ellie, the girl who was the secondary protagonist and the player character's companion in The Last of Us. The game is set five years after the ending of the original. Both Ellie (who is by 19 now) and Joel survived and live in Jackson, Wyoming, where Ellie is dating another girl, Dina. However, the characters have to deal with the evil cult called the Seraphites, who try to sacrifice their former members. A matter of revenge forces Ellie and her friends to undertake a trip to Seattle, Washington, to kill their enemies. The major theme of the plot is Ellie's dealing with her hate issues.GameplayUnlike in the original game, the player controls Ellie instead of Joel, who now becomes her AI-controlled companion. The game features improved controls that include new options such as crawling, dodging, and a jump button. A new AI system allows the human adversaries to communicate share information with each other. The game also introduces multiplayer."

    "about": [
      "The Last Oricru is an action RPG, that puts you in the middle of ongoing conflict under the protective shield on the otherwise abandoned planet. Your decisions bring interesting twists into the gameplay as you can heavily influence the conflict and its outcome. You will experience hundreds of intense fights in a brutal medieval sci-fi world, where every action has its consequences. Level up your hero and improve your skills before facing one of many boss fights.Intriguing StoryIn the world of The Last Oricru the advanced technology is mostly forgotten. The last remains are perceived as magical objects and only a few chosen ones can be used. Some of the advanced technology such as Cradle of Life, can be used by The Last Oricru only.Impactful DecisionsMassive decision tree in which your decisions lead to a different outcome, affecting story, characters, game endings but also visuals of levels or the gameplay flow. Every action, sub-quest or death can affect your reputation with each faction. There are multiple ways to play through The Last Oricru - befriend everyone or be the bad guy with all the consequences.Challenging CombatThe combat is complex and aims to create a tough but rewarding experience. You will encounter various mass fights, in which you can influence already raging battles – take down enemy soldiers or come to their aid. Melee and ranged attacks, elemental damage (magic) and weight management offers a wide range of customization. Be prepared to die... A lot!Couch CoopThe game offers many situations that can be solved in co-op differently than in the single player. You can find new fun ways of how to win in boss fights or reach special secret areas. At the end of the day, combat is the bread and butter of any RPG so if you for example play as a melee tank, while the second player plays a magic support, you will enjoy tens of awesome hours of shared fun!"

We knew it were lying and we did it anyway. We’ve carried that shame around with us for years, a burden weighing on every moment of every day.Enough is enough.It’s time to fix this, to unburden our shame. Let us give you our shame, for you to carry it around instead. We’re sick of it.From the liars who brought you the award winning indie game The Stanley Parable comes The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, an expansion to the original game with more content, more endings, more whimsical adventures of the two best friends Stanley and The Narrator. Coming to PC and consoles in 2019.Tastefully seasoned with the bitter remorse of having deceived so many loyal fans for so long.But seriously, this time it’s done. No more."

It was the first game we made, ever, and it was a big moment for us then. Going back to this place and remaking the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it feels just as big, if not bigger,” said Adam Badowski, Head of Studio, CD PROJEKT RED. “Collaborating with Fool’s Theory on the project is just as exciting, as some of the people there have been previously involved in The Witcher games. They know the source material well, they know how much gamers have been looking forward to seeing the remake happen, and they know how to make incredible and ambitious games. And although it will take some time before we’re ready to share more about and from the game, I know it’ll be worth the wait."

      "The gameplay of the game is based on intense strategic battles between the Navigator and the defenders in a limited space. Locations in the game consist of a multi-level object (for example, a multi-storey building), inside which there are defenders, and the area around it, where the attackers begin.Destruction is at the head of the game mechanics. The surrounding objects are created with maximum realism, the degree of damage depends on the calibre of the bullets used by the players or on the total power of the laid explosives. Walls can be destroyed, creating new firing positions and shelters. Optimal use of the potential of destruction often becomes a guarantee of victory. Defenders can limit the ability of attackers to destroy, using kits to strengthen the walls and the device of some operatives.The primary game mode - multiplayer, normal or rating. During the game in the last mode, the player is assigned a certain rank, and parameters such as the ratio of kills/deaths and wins/losses are recorded in his profile displayed in the game."

Expanding the story behind Henry Avery's actions in history the story once again feels like Indiana Jones kind of adventure. The grappling hook, climbing on rocks and mountains, or diving from the top, Nathan still engages into hand to hand combat with his enemies as well as using firearms. Nolan North, Emily Rose, and Richard McGonagle return to the final installment in the series to say farewell to the story of Nathan Drake for the last time."

      "Wayward Strand is a touching, empathetic narrative game, woven together from many distinct threads, all of which play out simultaneously aboard an airborne hospital in 1970s Australia.In Wayward Strand you play as Casey Beaumaris, a teenage girl visiting the hospital for the first time. Over the course of three days, she will explore the history of the ship, the lives of its inhabitants, and their relationships to one another.Once aboard, she can visit the rooms of the ship’s odd and delightful residents, choosing who she wants to spend her time with, and get to know. She can also shadow the staff and snoop around; or explore the ship itself, seeking to uncover the secrets of its murky past.The hospital’s residents are an eclectic cast of characters – some charming, some eccentric, some rude – each with their own desires, goals and imaginations. They do as they wish, completely independent of the player character.During the three days Casey spends on the ship, the characters around her live out their own stories - stories which she can investigate. Each character moves and acts of their own accord, on their own timeline - sharing news with each other, opinions; arguing; joking; gossiping - or having a chat with Casey when she comes by.As Casey explores the airship and its many intertwined stories, she will discover that the effect of her actions can reverberate far beyond her expectations.Key Features: Deep Story - Over a dozen characters, each with their own timeline and story.Living World - All stories play out in real-time, along-side each other, throughout the ship.Follow Your Curiosity - Eavesdrop on, follow, and talk to your favourite character to discover their stories.Casey’s Notebook - Follow leads, investigate mysteries and strange happenings.A Unique Experience - Choose your own path through the world as it moves around you.Join us on Discord! https://discord.gg/KDAMU3N"
