      "F. E. A. R. 2: Project Origin is a first-person shooter with elements of horror, the sequel to the game F. E. A. R.The game has an abundance of scenes of violence and anatomically detailed images of dead bodies, what makes the atmosphere oppressive.You play as a Delta Force operator Michael Becket during your most common mission, which is gradually turning into a struggle for survival against the wrath of Alma. After the terrible power of Alma is out of control, your squad is forced to break through the apocalyptic wilds, defending their lives in parallel, as well as looking for a lot of clues about how to destroy it!Most of the gameplay the game borrows from the first game of the series. Now in the game, there is no possibility to look out from behind a corner on which replacement the system of shelters is entered (the player can use objects which surround him, for the creation of the essential shelters, for example, to turn a table or to open a car door). Also, there was an indicator of \"fatigue\" (if the scale is full, it will give the opportunity to make a short-term sprint)."

      "A golfing spin-off in the famous Worms series. Worms Crazy Golf - it's a familiar mix of the main series gameplay and classic golf transforming the latter into turn-based madness. Now the main goal is not to destroy all of the enemy’s worms. The goal is to get into the hole with fewer strikes. The game is a continuation of the mobile-exclusive Worms Golf and adaptation of the format on the PC.The player takes control of the worm, which appears on the 2D battlefield. The goal is to drive the ball into the hole. Sometimes on the way, there are explosive sheep that explode to shreds in a collision and other obstacles to overcome. Visually, the game is reminiscent of the game series of the era of 2D Worms 2: Armageddon and Worms Reloaded.For a single completion, there are 3x 18 holes courses all with its own visual style and challenges. As well as 15 challenges without complete courses. Also, there is multiplayer available for up to four players on the same device with the alternate right of turn. Worms can be customized to your taste. To do this, you must earn in-game cash to spend it on cosmetic items."

In Super Pole Riders, a player is supposed to keep the ball on the end of a zip line by operating a pole – the ball can be either pushed along or kicked. Hokra is a minimalist competition between two teams which objective is to possess the ball for the maximum of time and to keep it in the team’s territory. Johann Sebastian Joust (or simply J. S. Joust) is an individual game in which player attempts to interfere other players’ controller manipulations by increasing the speed of background music playing.Key featuresThe whole game is simulating a retro-fashioned aesthetics. It is a multi-feature competition which can be focused not only on graphics but also on audio and provides various forms of participation to 2-4 players. Johann Sebastian Joust is compatible only with Linux or Mac OS. It is the most minimalistic variation of the game as it does not require the use of the monitor and is non-graphic. Super Pole Riders is a sequel to Pole Riders, providing more options of the ball’s control."

It is the eighth installment in the series.Underworld continues the story of Tomb Raider: Legend and Tomb Raider: Anniversary. Lara tries to unravel the secrets told in the ancient Scandinavian legends in order to find Avalon - a place where her mother disappeared years ago.TR: Underworld is played from a third-person perspective. The game features a very interactive world. Lara leaves footprints in the snow, mud sticks to her legs if she kneels and could be later washed away with rain, the damage done to the environment is permanent and enemies' bodies do not disappear. A dynamic animation system is present in the game which allows for more character interaction with the world.The developers put a strong emphasis on the fact that Lara is able to do anything that the players expect from her from grabbing a ledge to using her grappling hook to pull objects.The game is non-linear to some degree as multiple mini-puzzles are present on several levels."

      "The second installment in the God of War franchise and exclusive for the Sony PlayStation 2 console. The game uses basics from the hack-and-slash genre, like its predecessor, and was developed by Santa Monica studio, which is a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment. The game is recognized as one of the best for the console from Sony and the best game in action genre in 2007. The game was released on Sony Playstation 2 already at the moment when the third version of the console was already selling for four months. The developers explained their decision: one hundred million people already playing on PlayStation 2, whereas on the next-generation console gamers were just going to adopt the new hardware.Key featuresThe player controls Kratos, who in the first part killed the god of war Ares and took his place. The game heavily relies on the ancient Greek mythology and uses it as inspiration and the main source for enemies and NPC design as well as locations design. However, the game is not a great source of accurate historical facts: Ancient Greece history was rewritten for the sake of the genre and the game universe, the rules of which were established in the first part.The storyKing of the gods Zeus betrays Kratos and kills him, but the Spartan is saved from the Underworld by another goddess Gaia, who invites Kratos to find the Sisters of Fate and go to the past and prevent his own murder. The gameplay remained the same: the player can use several attacks, which can be combined and improved with the help of the in-game currency collected from enemies. The game has a lot of Quick-Time-Events, mostly they are used in battles with bosses and in finishing combo-moves. Bosses in the game, in comparison with the first part, significantly increased."

      "GRID is a racing game that lets the player dive into the motorsport, assume the real racer’s role and even control their own racing team. Races and racing championships are held in three main locations – the United States, Europe, and Japan. All racing circuits in the game are the mixture of imaginary and the existing ones. The gameplay is divided into 6 racing classes: GT championships, drifting, touge (climbing the narrow mountain pass like Pikes Peak), open wheel racing, demolition derby, and 24 Hours of Le Mans (additional at the end of the season). Each car of 43 available in the game is tied to one of the event types. Several professional teams compete within these championships. Therefore, to start the career player have to choose one of the disciplines and a professional team to join. While progressing GRID gives an opportunity to create your own racing team, hire sponsors and other drivers, and participate in different events. The gameplay also has a remarkable feature called “flashback” that allows rewinding time to prevent driver’s mistakes."

Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.Brink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark.

      "Demon’s Souls is an action RPG, the first installment in the Souls series, known mostly because of the Dark Souls trilogy. Demon’s Souls is also set in a grey-colored dark medieval-themed world that is attacked by the demon fog. You take on the role of a knight that entered the fog trying to save the kingdom from demons. He was eventually killed and reborn, and now needs to travel the entire kingdom to gain power and set the world free.Your character is fully customizable and can be upgraded with souls you get through battles. Demon’s Souls combat system is quite complicated as you can’t gain experience killing ordinary enemies to defeat the boss later. Here you need to work out unique tactics for every monster type. As a result, the gameplay is quite challenging with frequent deaths.However, there’s a way to simplify the game a little. Some of your actions, for example, killing or helping NPCs, affect the gameplay. This parameter is called tendency; when it’s white, the enemies are easier and the rewards are fewer. When it’s black, it produces the opposite effect."

While the goal is the same - to reach the finish first, the game allows trying another side of races as you need to stop a lawbreaker in the police part of the game.Unlike typical racing titles, Hot Pursuit follows the principle that \"all is fair.\" That's why both sides have special tools to stop the opponent. You can throw spikes on the road or use turbo acceleration to break away from the pursuit. Police can block the road and summon a helicopter for help from above. Additionally, Hot Pursuit features a new Autolog social system. With it, you can compete with your friends and see the statistics on every race. The system compares your results with your friends' ones and notifies you every time your record is beaten."

The game is an endless side-scrolling runner, the first time it appeared on devices running the iOS. Later the game was ported to other platforms, among which two unusual for the first decade of the twenty-first century: browsers in the form of the flash game and Sony Playstation Portable.

The game is often compared to another mobile hit of the era - the game Fruit Ninja, in which the player needs to cut fruits.Key featuresThe game uses simple one-button control, for which the player can quickly adapt. Pressing the button raises the main character, and if the player releases the button, the protagonist falls. The game has a huge number of upgrades and a lot of enemies. Levels are full of obstacles, in order to get to the next, you need to fly a certain distance, after which the visual style of surroundings and enemies will change. The further you fly, the harder it is.Continuous supportDespite being released a long time ago, developers are still updating the game. The story tells about Barry Steakfries, who worked as a vendor in the gramophone manufacturer. The company eventually closed due to poor sales and the main character ended wandering the streets where he stumbles upon a jetpack. Dreaming of such a device in childhood, the main character does not hesitate to put it on and goes on the adventure."

The only purpose of it is to get revenge. The game features 50 single-player levels in 6 different areas. With every completed level, the player disrupts one of the systems of the device that was infected with TOM. Each area represents one device which is used by humans in a utopian world. 50 more are available for cooperative play. The players objective is to connect all the nodes creating connection paths for them while avoiding the anti-virus drones present in the game. Sometimes, the player has to correctly turn the nodes in order to establish a connection. The enemies move in a repetitive pattern of traveling back and forth. While easily avoidable alone, the game gets harder and harder as the number of enemies increases."

      "Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an action adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics. The title serves as a spin-off to Tomb Raider series and is not connected to the series storyline whatsoever.Two thousand years ago there was a battle between the Guardian of Light and the Keeper of Darkness. The Keeper won using the Mirror of Smoke with which he summoned a horde of horrible monsters, but the Guardian survived the encounter and imprisoned the Keeper in his own mirror. Fast-forward to the present day. Lara Croft finds the legendary mirror, but she does not know what evil it contains. The game puts a strong emphasis on cooperative play, yet it is possible to complete the game alone. While the previous installments in the series featured an action third-person camera, Guardian of Light is using a fixed isometric camera. The players can choose to play either as the Guardian himself or as Lara Croft with each character having their own abilities.Puzzles differ when played alone or in co-op mode. This was done in order to make the players rely less on AI."

Always on the cutting edge of progress, with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites, it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.Enter, the “Synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and cosplayers. Those victimized by Synthisters take on the properties of their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.AKIBA’S TRIP tells the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named Nanashi who was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and transformed into one of the walking undead. He, however, was spared the worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter named Shizuku. Together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save Akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.And of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…KEY FEATURESFaithful Recreation of Japan’s Electronics MeccaLike a virtual tour of Tokyo’s Akihabara district, all major outdoor locations from the town have been painfully recreated, with over 130 real-life shops accurately represented.Unique and Customizable Brawler-Style CombatAnything can be a weapon, from baseball bats to comics to motherboards, and individual clothing items may be targeted, stripped and added to the player’s own inventory.Satirical Story with Divergent Paths and Multiple EndingsPlaying off common anime and video game tropes for social satire, the player’s choices determine how the story progresses, leading to one of many unique endings.Modern Day Setting Enhances Gameplay Options and Adds Pop Culture FeelThe in-game smartphone is used to check email, read comments on “Pitter,” take side quests, catalog ad flyers, launch apps to identify the undead and much, much more.Please note that the buildings and monuments depicted in the game AKIBA'S TRIP are based on the Akihabara town area from the fall of 2012 through the summer of 2013."

      "Edge is an isometric puzzle platformer. You control a cube and need to lead it through levels to the goal, collecting light prisms and trying not to fall off the map. You see the map from the isometric perspective, and the cube moves diagonally. There are 45 main and 3 unlockable levels in the game. The key feature of the gameplay is the ability of the cube to balance at the certain angle. You need this to complete the most difficult parts of the route. When rolling is not enough, you can climb a moving block to overcome an obstacle or perform any other maneuver. However, these tricks are not easy to master.However, Edge challenges your reflexes more than your ability to solve puzzles. The game usually gives direct hints about where to go and what to do to pass the level but it’s quite difficult to perform this safely. Problems can appear only with collecting all the prisms as they can be hidden. In general, the entire game is created in simple polygonal style so nothing distracts you from completing levels."

There is a catch, though; the adversary has been feeding her with the cake that grows in a nearby forest to make her heavier to carry. Therefore, it's going to take most of your army working together to carry her back across the battlefield. Luckily, Fat Princess supports up to 32 players online simultaneously so plenty of help is available. Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess, one of the PlayStation Network's most anticipated titles ever, as players can switch between five different character classes literally at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation, whether it's flinging another player over the enemy's walls with a teeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding your muscle to carry the princess faster."

    "about": [
      "Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is a spin-off installment of the Might & Magic fantasy franchise. It is a part of Ubisoft reboot of the series that features the new setting, Ashan, albeit similar to the original Enroth.PlotClash of Heroes takes place in the medieval high fantasy world. It is set 40 years before the events depicted in Heroes of Might and Magic V. The game follows five heroes. Two of them already featured in HoM&M V (Godric the knight and Anwen the elf), while three others are original (Aidan, who commands demons, a wizard Nadia and a necromancer Fiona). They oppose the demon lord who is searching for an artifact called Blade of Binding. He is going to use it to open the portal into his demon world and unleash his armies on Ashan.GameplayIn the campaign mode, the player assumes the role of one hero of his or her choice. Each hero represents one of the five traditional HoM&M factions (humans, elves, demons, wizards, and the undead) and has his or her unique roster of units. Heroes navigate the map in real-time, but the battles are turn-based. Like in HoM&M games, the heroes command their armies rather than fight on their own. The combat system, however, changed dramatically. In Clash of Heroes, it resembles a puzzle game of colored columns and rows. MultiplayerThere are both local and online multiplayer modes that allow two players to compete against each other, to cooperate against AI or the other team of two players."

      "PAYDAY The Heist is a dynamic co-op shooter that allows players to assume the role of a bank robber and to try on the criminal life from the first-person view. This game is the first part of the PAYDAY series and the beginning of the story of four outlaws – Dallas, Hoxton, Chains and Wolf. The gameplay is about completing 6 different heists throughout America alone (with bots) or in a team (up to 4 members). Each robbery could be carried out in two separate ways: players should decide whether stealth or a breakthrough attack is more suitable and prepare all the ammunition properly in advance. The squad of criminals searching for another “big score” is set up against easy-to-manipulate civilians and powerful police forces, so players are to try their best to prevent the alarm signals and not to face armed resistance. However, if the heavy combat begins, the best option will be to keep shooting countless enemies down till the money is in the bag and the heist is over."

One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters."

      "Dustforce is a platformer in which the main character is a janitor. The player takes control of one of their four janitors who use acrobatic tricks and a mop to clear dirt and filth from more than 50 levels of the game. Janitors differ slightly in characteristics such as the height of the jump. After completing the level, the player receives an evaluation from the game based on the finesse of the playthrough.The game is often compared to such takes on the genre such as Super Meat Boy and N , where the main emphasis is on timings and player’s quick reaction. Cleaning is automatic, and enemies need to be defeated by performing attacks. After the death, the level begins from the previous checkpoint. There is also a local multiplayer for four players and a level editor in addition to game’s singleplayer. In multiplayer, different variations of Survival and King of the Hill modes are available: some players remove the mud spread out by the level of other players. In October 2014, there was a  free DX Update released for the game, in which the developers have added new levels and maps."

      "Driver: San Francisco is the fifth game in the Driver franchise. It is a game about chases with a crime thriller plot.PlotPlotwise, Driver: San Francisco serves as a sequel to Driver 3 rather than the previous installment, Driver: Parallel Lines. As with the rest of the Driver series, the main character is John Tanner, a police detective, and a talented driver. Tanner is chasing the mobster Charles Jericho who survived the events of Driver 3. While awaiting trial in San Francisco, Jericho escapes the custody and wrecks chaos in the city. Tanner is injured and falls into a coma. While unconscious, the protagonist discovers he has a supernatural power to inhabit other people's bodies. It allows him to continue the chase.GameplayThe game is set in a thoroughly modeled San Francisco complete with its famous landmarks. Unlike in the three previous games, Tanner cannot leave the car and walk around. Instead, Driver: San Francisco introduces a new option called Shift, using which the protagonist instantly changes vehicles. This is explained as a supernatural ability to switch bodies. The game also reintroduces the popular Film Director mode. It allows the player to replay his or her adventures using various cameras so that the walkthrough video looks almost like a movie.MultiplayerThe game is the first in the series to introduce both local and online multiplayer. There are several modes that include a vehicular tag game and other variations of a competitive chase game."

      "Ambitius crossoverOne of the most ambitious crossovers in the history of crossovers. Heroes of two iconic series of fighting games will battle against each other at the most popular locations from both franchises.Story and settingDespite the format, the game has a story: according to it, the world was hit by a cataclysm - an object of unknown origin fell into Antarctica. It emits water-like energy that enhances the capabilities of the fighters. For most fighters, the story is standard. The exception is made for the anchor characters from both series: Ryu and Ken or Kazuya and Nina. In total, the game has 38 characters, 19 of each series.Key FeaturesIn terms of gameplay, the game is a mix of two combat systems: there are mechanics as Super Combos and EX Attacks from Street Fighter built into the classic for Tekken gameplay. All characters from SF series are controlled by a six-button system, and for Tekken fighters, a standard four-button control is available. Players choose two characters: one from each universe. Fighters can be changed right during the battle. The game also features two new mechanics: the Gem System and Pandora Mode. Thanks to the first, the player can put up to three gems on the fighter that improve from the characteristics, and the second turns on when one of the fighters left less than 25% of health. In this case, this character can be sacrificed in favor of Pandora Mode, which enhances the remaining character strength and gives an infinite Cross Gauge."

      "SingStar is a singing game, distributed for free for PlayStation consoles. The series has been going on for 14 years already, developing the games for all of the PlayStation since PS2. Crucial to notice: it is not a rhythm game but a singing game. Here the players need to sing karaoke-style, not match screen patterns with the background beats. Every version of the game differs from the previous one by the song list. It is rare that any technological improvement is included. For example, PS Move support or a special microphone release.SingStar (2014) adds AR function for the PS4 gamers: it is now possible to see the lyrics or even avatars through the camera. Other than that it is just a competitive game featuring no plot whatsoever. The Party Mode includes up to eight singers simultaneously — the competitions like 'Pass the Mic,' or 'Medley' are available there."

      "Humanity has just solved problems like global warming - with the help of robots. Robot assistants were American, behaved correctly and differed from people clearly. But one madman from Tokyo began to produce robots that do not know that they are robots - and this can be understood because they look and behave exactly like people. This is a violation of the law, and the team of pros from different countries flies to Japan to forever stop the conveyor of the insane inventor. Robots with problems of self-identification can provide a variety for those fans of tactical shooters who are tired of terrorists and zombies.The game has visually attractive features. The style of opponents, the style of equipping the team of heroes are very attractive and original. Some details of the battles are well presented - bullets knock out picturesque clouds of debris. Locations are less expressive - apparently, so as not to interfere with focusing on the actual combat. A notable feature of the gameplay is the dependence of the relationship in the team on the player's actions. If the team has bad mutual support - lower trust, lower trust - lower effectiveness in combat."

Upon breaking free, the army turns the people of the kingdom into sand statues.

Now Isaac not only has to escape but uncover the dark secrets of Ishimura, while looking for the clues about the whereabouts of his girlfriend Nicole.Dead Space accents the survival aspect of the game, by keeping minimal UI and keeping HUD on the armor, making sure that the players can see the corners of the screen. Only weapons Isaac has access to are his engineer tools, which can all be upgraded with the limited supplies. Dead Space introduces a new variant of zombies called Necromorphs, that are highly mobile and instead of aiming for the head, players will be asked to attack the limbs, in order to incapacitate and slow them down, eventually killing them."

    "about": [
      "Riptide is a standalone expansion pack to the game Dead Island from the Polish studio Techland. The action takes place immediately after the end of the original game: the main characters assumed that they escaped danger, but fate decreed otherwise and they find themselves on a ship full of zombies.According to the schedule and the gameplay, the game was not far from its predecessor. The game is still a mixture of first-person action-RPG and survival horror. Just like in the first game, the character gains new levels, upgrades skills and buys new equipment. Structurally, the game has changed little: the player is again forced to perform repetitive tasks and seek salvation.The campaign can be completed in solo or in a cooperative mode. The level of complexity, in this case, increases accordingly. The game realistically recreates the process of dismembering the bodies of zombies which is franchise is known for. Developers also tuned the game setting a bit, fixed the bugs and shortcomings of the previous game."

    "about": [
      "Castle Crashers is 2D beat-em-up game with role-playing elements developed by Behemoth. It was initially released in 2008 via Xbox Live Arcade with following ports for PS3, Windows, and macOS. In 2015 it was remastered as Castle Crashers Remastered and was released for Xbox One.  You play as a knight sent by the king to defeat an evil wizard who stole the king’s daughters and captured and mystical gem. The gameplay is very reminiscent of older side-scrolling beat-em-up titles. It can be summarized as a player has to defeat waves of enemies in different locations using his weapons and magical abilities. However, it also incorporates some role-playing elements such as acquiring gaining new levels which allow a player to enhance his stats and acquire new moves. One of the gameplay’s focal points is cooperative multiplayer with the support for up to 4 players which is available both locally and online.  The game shares significant Behemoth hand-drawn visual style which was used before in Alien Hominid and would be later used in studio’s BattleBlock Theater and Pit People."

The action starts from an uninhabited island called Katorga-12.An electromagnetic surge from the island hits an American satellite, and the unit goes there to investigate the place. Another surge damages the crew’s helicopter; Nathaniel is the only person who stays alive. He fades out to find himself in the past. At this point, the plot twists; every event in the past has an impact on the present. Back in 1955, Nathaniel meets Nikolai Demichev, a Soviet scientist working at Katorga-12. Further on, Renko and Demichev run against each other during the whole story; their interactions are at the core of the game. GameplaySingularity is the first-person shooter; the player performs the protagonist's actions. The main gameplay device is not a weapon, but an artifact called the Time Manipulation Device. Using that, the player can move the protagonists and objects around back and forth in time. At some point the player has to make choices; they affect the game result. The game also has multiplayer modes; the player can perform either as a soldier or as a creature, one of the individuals inhabiting Katorga-12. Key featuresThe game’s concept is based on the Cold War era. Some features are inspired by exploration of military bases back in the 20th century and by sci-fi movies."

All events of the 2020 incident, especially the human-alien conflict, were kept secret, and CryNet Systems is hunting for survivors of the first contact. However, the extraterrestrial race of Ceph did not give up its plans on the Earth. Crysis 2 introduces the new protagonist, a US Marine codenamed Alcatraz. Prophet, the squad leader from Crysis, also makes an appearance, and his recorded memories guide Alcatraz as he uncovers the alien plot. As in every game of the series, the protagonist is armed with a futuristic Nano Muscle Suit, a military exoskeleton that adsorbs damage, heals and strengthens the wearer. The suits were updated since Crysis, introducing modules for suit customization and a new Tactical mode. The player can now use multiple suit modes at the same time. Most levels are set in the urban environment this time to distinguish the game from the original. Alcatraz is eventually tasked with defending New York from the alien invasion, and the battle ensues at iconic places like Times Square. The game also includes a multiplayer mode that pits the United States Marine Corps against C.E.L.L. mercenaries."

    "about": [
      "Battlefield Bad Company is unique in the series \"Battlefield\" in that it features a full single-player campaign with characters. The previous titles were mostly focused on multiplayer with large numbers of players.The game is retaining the vehicular and large-scale warfare but emphasizes squad-based combat.The First Russo-American War and the private campaign of Bad CompanySerdaristan, a small Caucasian country, became a place for a big war between Russia and the United States. First in Serdaristan, then in the Middle East, in the town of Sadiz on the coast of the Caspian Sea, the 222th Battalion, also known as the \"Bad Company\", puts itself under bullets. The name \"Bad Company\" is not accidental - the detachment consists of people who are best able to deliver problems.One of the columns of the Bad Company was destroyed when it was sent to the battlefield. In investigating this case, the Bad Company's soldiers find out that they are not opposed by the Russian army, but mercenaries to whom Russia pays gold. Since then, the Bad Company has been fighting not only for the victory and glory of its country, but also for the sake of gold, which can be obtained in the pockets of defeated opponents.The Newby and the TeamPreston Marlowe is the main protagonist of the game. He just came to the Bad Company - just before the Bad Company found a new goal for itself - gold.Sergeant Samuel D. Redford is the commander of the Bad Company and the only one who came there as a volunteer. He just likes to fight.George Gordon Haggard, Jr. - has an explosive nature. And he knows everything about explosives.Terrence Sweetwater - smart ass.GameplayThe player acts with one main weapon and another, used in the second turn. In addition to this, there are grenades, a knife and portable explosive devices. The player always has information about the number of remaining ammunition. If vehicles are not completely destroyed, they can be repaired any number of times. Military vehicles in the game are sufficient: infantry fighting vehicles, armored cars, tanks, attack helicopters, patrol boats, mobile anti-aircraft weapon system.For the first time in the Battlefield games line, the Frostbite game engine is used - 90% of the environment can be destroyed.

    "title": "Shoot Many Robots",
    "about": [
      "The title sums it up pretty well, but if you still need convincing:  A 4-player co-op run-n-gun action shooter that throws you into a tidal wave of degenerate robots with an array of weaponry that would make any mama proud.  A classic 2.5D side-scrolling shooter, revitalized with modern game design.You take control of P. Walter Tugnut (The “P” stands for “Pickles”), a regular guy who stockpiles guns, ammo, and beer in his dilapidated RV awaiting the inevitable robot apocalypse. When the abandoned factory in the distance begins producing robots on its own, Walter sets off in his RV on a robot-killing rampage, hoping to save humanity from an onslaught of robot hordes.Developed by Demiurge Studios, collaborators on Borderlands™, Brothers in Arms®, and Mass Effect™.Key Features:4-Player Co-op Up to four players online working together to take down robot armies.Character CustomizationWearing a tutu isn’t just a fashion statement; it’s a strategy.  Hundreds and hundreds of crazy guns and accessories to unlock, each giving unique stat boosts and special abilities.  Level up and gain XP by killing robots, boosting Walter’s stats.  Unlock new missions and equipment.MissionsPush forward through robot territory in Run-n-Gun missions – huge levels that end in uncomfortably epic robot boss battles. Hunker down in Survival missions – claustrophobic levels where the only object is to outlast waves of robot hordes.  Tons of missions to fight through, all the way up to the ultimate challenge: Insane mode.Diversified CombatTake two weapons with you into battle – but it's going to be a tough choice.  Revolvers, rocket launchers, assault rifles, flamethrowers, SMGs, and shotguns all beg to be used – not to mention the freeze ray, gnome launcher, and a cat carrier that shoots an exploding robot decoy.Punch BulletsAlso, you can punch bullets.  In the game, I mean.Robots with PersonalityNumerous robots – from tiny chainsaw-wielding Choppers to gigantic fire-spewing Fatboys – all have unique personalities, AI, and unique ways to kill, with even fiercer models appearing as the difficulty ramps up.PC-Specific FeaturesFrom the team that brought Mass Effect to the PC, Shoot Many Robots has been upgraded and overhauled specifically for the platform.Lookin’ GoodLooks even better with support for higher resolutions (like 2560x1600!) and the game now runs at 60 fps!Feelin’ GoodAll interfaces and controls have been overhauled and optimized specifically for mouse and keyboard.  Customizable key mapping is also now available.But Wait, There’s More!Fully integrated Steam matchmakingFacebook matchmakingAchievementsIn-game & Steam leaderboardsIntegrated voice chat"

    "title": "Skullgirls",
    "about": [
      "Skullgirls is a fighting game developed by Lab Zero and primarily published by Marvelous and Autumn Games. Since its initial release in 2012, it has received two free extensions, Skullgirls Encore and Skullgirls 2nd Encore and while its roster initially consisted of an all-female cast of 8 characters, 6 more characters were added, 5 being developed thanks to the game's Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, including 2 male characters. At its release, Skullgirls was developed by Reverge Labs, but the team that created the game split off from the company to form Lab Zero. In Japan, the game is published by Arc System Works. On Nintendo Switch, the game is published by Skybound Games.Skullgirls takes place in the Canopy Kingdom, inspired by 1940s America, in which corruption and conflict runs rampant. Once every seven years, an artifact called the Skull Heart appears, granting the wish of one woman. However, if the Skull Heart is used by a woman with impure intentions, it will control her, turning her into a destructive monster called the Skullgirl. Not once has anyone used the Skull Heart without falling to its curse. The game follows the stories of 14 characters on their way to face the Skullgirl and retrieve the Heart, be it for the greater good or simply their own gain.The game is a tribute to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and its mechanics are intended as a more polished version of the classic fighting game title, with some original ideas. In a standard player vs. player match, each player controls one character out a chosen number of one to three characters which they can switch to at any time. They can also call their inactive characters to perform assist attacks. Like most Marvel vs. Capcom-inspired games, Skullgirls is fast-paced and features long, complex combos based on animation cancels. It introduces a burst system which allows players to break their opponent's combo if it becomes too long.Skullgirls features a 'dark deco'-inspired art style mixed with some horror themes and a jazz and rock soundtrack consisting of 28 tracks. In 2013, the game set the Guinness World Record Gamer's Edition record for most average frames of animation per character in a video game, reaching 1,439 frames per character and 11,515 frames total for its initial eight-character roster.In February 2013, Skullgirls came in second in a crowdfunding event organized by fighting game website Shoryuken to decide what would be the final game featured on the EVO 2013 line up, with all proceeds sent to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Skullgirls raised over $US 78,000. While it was not featured as an EVO main game, EVO organizers supported the game's side event by providing prize money and advertisement."

      "GRID 2 is a racing game, the sequel to Race Driver: GRID. In the centre of the \"story\" GRID 2 is a racing championship, which we gradually promote around the world. Money is not needed, the main thing is to conquer the audience. The race will be held in such places as Paris, Hong Kong, Chicago, Dubai, etc. All the tracks, drivers, teams, cars and sponsors in the game are real.Compared to GRID (the first part of the series), there are more modes. There were races on the so-called \"Checkpoint\",  endurance race and other several options. And the significant thing now that there is no driving on the rails, sudden acceleration of rivals and unpunished wiping of bumpers (also, damage to the machine is not displayed on the screen, it is necessary to focus on its behaviour and the replica of racing engineer).The main feature of GRID is time rewinding. The number of rewinds is limited, but with this, you can save yourself from a fatal outcome."

From the athletic figure and the hoarse voice to short phrases that leave no doubt in the victory. He goes to the past, for it can return everything as it was.This type of hero sets everything else, the plot is clear and straightforward - run and shoot. It happens on twelve levels, the landscapes of which are created by Nature for bloody and dynamic battles. Everyone who likes to shoot and run will be happy with everything in this game. The best in the genre is collected in one place and cleaned to chemical purity. Even the monsters you meet as old friends - and they also try for you with all their might. They roar, beat and shoot, covering the sky.There are enough weapons in the game, including hand-to-hand combat skills. Separate pleasure - if you kill monsters by your hands, you need to find your own approach to each. One monster needs to be pulled out of the eye, the other will die only if you wrest the heart. The heart, by the way, can then be thrown in someone - it can kill. There are a lot of pleasant surprises of this kind in the game."

They fall in love, but due to their incompatible environments, they can't stay together. However, if they become so entwined that they learn to move in complete unison, they can merge into a dragon. This creature can traverse any environment.ControlsThe player takes control of both protagonists at the same time. Being a PlayStation exclusive title, Entwined strongly relies on the console's controller analog sticks.

On their way, they have to gather collectible gems and avoid obstacles. The collectibles are color-coded orange and blue for the fish and the bird, respectively. Completing these objectives allows the player to fill two colored meters while hitting obstacles drops the meters down. Once they are full, the two souls begin to merge.

      "Hustle Kings is a pool game released exclusively for PlayStation consoles. GameplayThe video game represents a classic kind of pool games, the eight-ball type, which is played on a table with six pockets along the rails, a full rack of fifteen balls and the cue ball. The goal is to claim a suit, pocket all of the balls, then pocket them, while denying one's opponent opportunities to do the same with their suit, and without sinking the balls early accidentally. The player wins if he pockets eight balls into a selected pocket, if the opposing player illegally pockets the eight balls, or if the opposing player knocks the eight balls off the table. Key featuresIn Hustle Kings, the player can have a face-to-face or a team match, switch four career levels, do daily tasks for additional points, and upgrade the cue and the balls. The game features a career mode as well as various trick shot and tournament modes. It also features online play which allows the player to compete against other players. Hustle Kings lets the user play their external music from the PlayStation 3 hard drive during matches. It also lets them implement the YouTube API to record video of their gameplay and upload it on the platform. The developers add rudimentary virtual reality support and Move control support so that the player could feel as if the game is performed for real. It is possible to use VR; the functions don't change much, but the player can look at balls closer than ever before."

      "DiRT 3 is a racing simulator that differs from its rivals because of unusual races and a huge variety of cars that includes modern sports models along with retro cars. Instead of fancy stadiums, the game offers you to drive through snowy landscapes of Finland and dirty roads of London's suburbs. In the career mode, you need to compete with other racers to gain the interest of sponsors. The higher your rank becomes, the more cars become available.  While DiRT 3 and the series in general is famous for its responsive controls and simple physics that make these games easy to master for newcomers, DiRT 3 features a quite challenging new mode - gymkhana. In this mode, you need to perform different tricks in a limited time period, such as drifting, jumping or spinning around. Gymkhana rounds are unskippable to progress in the career mode. Another key feature that highlights DiRT 3 is flashbacks - the mechanics that allows turning back time if you made a mistake during the race and driving a certain piece of the track again."

    "about": [
      "CounterSpy is an indie stealth game developed by Dynamighty.The game is inspired by the 60s style spy movies such as the James Bond series or The Man from U.N.K.L.E. Set in the Cold War, the player controls a spy that infiltrates the military bases of rival countries. The game is a 2.5D side-scroller but the players are able to target their weapons in a three-dimensional space. The main objective is to prevent the enemy from launching nuclear missiles. The players have to be cautious as getting detected affects the DEFCON status of a country in which the player is at the moment. If the player gets detected too often, the country enforces DEFCON 1 and launches uses its nuclear weaponry. The players can abort the launch if they make it in time, which results in completion of the level. Throughout the levels, the players can collect intelligence, which serves as an in-game currency. Intel is spent to buy ammo, upgrade your weapons or buy new ones."

      "Lost Planet 2 is a third-person shooter, the second installment in Capcom’s Lost Planet series. PlotThe game takes place on E.D.N. III, a planet full of hostile alien insectoids named Akrid. The story begins ten years after the events of the original game. The climate of E.D.N. III starts getting warmer. Military organization NEVEC begins a dangerous operation to exploit a unique Akrid Cat-G. The game consists of six episodes. In each of the player controls different characters, mainly from NEVEC’s spec-ops. GameplayThe game is divided into six episodes. Each of them consists of several chapters that in their turn consist of several missions. There are no checkpoints during the missions, so each of them requires a player to complete it in one sitting without dying. The player explores levels both by foot and via special mechanized armor suits known as Vital Suits. The Vital Suits have their own set of heavy weapons such as rocket launchers and chainsaw. On foot, the player can use a grappling hook to reach remote places or hang on other Vital Suits. MultiplayerThe game has the strong emphasis on multiplayer. It offers both cooperative and competitive modes. Versus multiplayer shares many similarities to previous games, adding new game modes and customization options."

      "PixelJunk Eden is a 2D casual platformer as well as the part of the vast series divided into the two periods: Eden takes place within the first period and occupies the third position in it. GameplayThe player controls the protagonist, Grimp, on its journey through the meditative worlds. The core gameplay mechanic is traveling by sticking to the objects. Locations called gardens to unlock when a certain amount of Spectra is met. The only enemies in the game are guardians — they can cut the protagonist's web which forces him to fall from the above. StoryThe game does not feature any prolonged narrative whatsoever. The absence of a wholesome storyline is compensated by the sound design, which creates the associations needed for the right attitude towards the game. The in-game mechanics also allow the title to have non-zero replayability.Interesting featuresPixelJunk Eden is the first game to support the PS3 trophy system natively — the other titles needed the appropriate patch. It is also the very musical game which is to be experienced through the artwork and sound design, not actual gameplay — Baiyon, the artist from Japan created all of the in-game backgrounds. The soundtrack and design have been largely contributed in by Dylan Cuthbert who has also created the sounds to the other PixelJunk titles."

The title implements conditionally open world consisting of various locations reminiscent from the original book. The player can travel between locations after the completing of the main story to mop up the collectibles and find an interaction that was earlier inaccessible due to lack of special powers and moves. Such skills are usually acquired within the first playthrough. The game does not feature an online multiplayer, unlike its predecessor.StoryThe plot of the game generally follows the last three books and four films about the Harry Potter's adventures. The game starts with events depicted in The Order of the Phoenix film and ends with a fight with Lord Voldemort."

      "The legacyThe original game was released for the Sega Genesis console with additional hardware that allowed the console from the late 80's to launch games on CD. From the point of view of gameplay, the game is not much different from other ones of the series of that time: it is a side-scrolling 2D platformer where the main goal of the player is to go as fast as possible. The game is often called the best in the series. In the development, it ought to be an improved version of the game Sonic The Hedgehog 2, but because of the low sales of the last, it was decided not to advertise connection between the two. Later the game was released on Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube as part of the Sonic Gems Collection. The remastered version that uses a new engine was released for various platforms and mobile devices in 2011.The plotThe plot of the game tells how Sonic goes to Never Lake, where the extraterrestrial body Little Planet appears at the end of the last month of each year. However, this time the main villain of the Sonic universe Dr. Robotnik tied the planet to the top of the mountain and began to transform its surface with the help of its robots into a huge factory. Sonic goes to the rescue to encounter not only Dr. Robotnik but also other characters in the series, such as Metal Sonic.Key featuresThe gameplay of the game has not changed: Sonic must complete levels and defeat bosses at the end of each world. After collecting 50 rings, a special level becomes available, on which the player must destroy six UFOs. The version of the game for Steam includes the ability to play in 16: 9, leaderboards and a bunch achievements."

    "about": [
      "DiRT Showdown is not a traditional racing simulator of the DiRT series. The only similar thing that relates Showdown to the original games is a high level of graphics: developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so the whole picture looks beautiful. This game offers an arcade physics that focus players on their positive emotions. Even the advanced damage system is only a cosmetic feature because damages don’t really affect car running performance. Everything in the game is made for the spectacle. The vehicle range was expanded: imaginary monsters specially prepared for the demolition were added to already existing licensed rally cars. Racing experience covers picturesque landscapes throughout America. All the events can be divided into four main classes (Racing, Demolition, Hoonigan, and Party) and then into numerous types. Gradual completion of the events gives money for buying new vehicles or upgrading existing ones and opens new perspectives for drivers. DiRT Showdown offers both single and multiplayer experience."

Useful things meet abundantly, their qualities are diverse, and they have a stable demand - you can sell or change them for something else in the city. The city is present at each of the levels of the game. In the city you can even play on the sweepstakes - to bet on yourself. For example, that you will never be killed, do not suffer damage more than the specified amount, or perform the task strictly up to a certain time. Heroes of the game are skilled in battles - they can even hold several different weapons in the same hand, summing their effects in one stroke. As you progress, the characters gain experience. With experience comes skill. If the experience is not enough, you can always recruit more, having passed any level repeatedly."

Frank enters the city by helicopter, the helicopter pilot is told to return to Frank in 72 hours. Frank quickly finds himself in a shopping center, where a crowd of people are trying to hide from the zombies - as it turns out, it was zombies that caused the closure of the city.Over the next 72 hours (this time is one of the strict conditions of the game), Frank must survive, save a few people and understand where the zombies came from. Along the way, he fights with zombies, seeks solutions, makes weapons and takes photographs - he is still a photojournalist. For successful shots, he gets more experience, which is appreciated in the game.Wheelchair with machine gunsThe second game \"forgets\" about Frank, it features a motorcyclist Chuck Green, who arrives in Willamet after all has settled down. There is a drug against turning into a zombie now, it is expensive, but effective. However, the new invasion of the zombie is still happening, Chuck drives around the town on a wheelchair with a pair of rifles, shooting hordes of zombies and simultaneously showing a touching concern for his daughter, who is somewhere nearby and needs a cure for zombification.Zombies give a second chanceThe third game \"resurrects\" Frank, who after success in the first game managed to fall to the bottom of life. In search of a new chance to succeed, Frank returns to Willameth, who seems to have been cleared of zombies twice, but Frank is very lucky - zombies capture the city for the third time. This time there are more enemies, among them many new ones. There are also more types of weapons - those that you need to do yourself from improvised means. Frank will visit places in the city that he did not suspect. Especially impressive will be a visit to the amusement park - \"Uranus Zone\"."

Some 30 years ago, a woman named Jeyne Kassynder led the rebellion and took over the power in the fantasy realm of Ehb. Kassynder framed the heroic 10th Legion, featured in Dungeon Siege, for the murder of the king, and nearly annihilated them.The player takes the role of an heir to one of the last surviving Legion members. There are four possible protagonists with pre-scripted backstories to choose from, and the main plot will slightly differ based on your choice. However, regardless of which character you choose, the other three will eventually appear in the game and can be recruited to accompany the player, one at a time.Each character has his or her unique set of skills and attacks. For example, Lucas, a knight, can withstand heavy damage in a melee fight. Katarina prefers ranged weapons and a little magic. Anjali is a shape-shifter who is a combination of both, depending on her current form, and Reinhart is a classic magician who uses energy spells. The controls are very different from the previous parts: the point-and-click approach was scrapped in favor of arrow keys and attack buttons."

As the player proceeds through the trilogy's storyline, they encounter a decades-long conflict between the Helghast and Vekta. Let alone two planets, both Helghan and Vekta are dwelled by humans after the Earth became uninhabitable. Killzone 2 explores a superplanet conflict through the eyes of Vekatn officer named Tomas \"Sev\" Sevchenko who is eager to find out the reasons conflict have burned up. One of the main attraction of a gameplay part is multiplayer — the first installment has not starred it. Online game reminisces the main story: the players play a role of either ISA or Helghast commander trying to defeat the opposing team. There are a total of 14 maps (8 being distributed on disc and 6 via DLC), 15 weapons and 7 classes in total."

As the title character, players jump around an isometric cube pyramid and convert each block’s color while avoiding familiar adversaries Coily, Ugg, Slick, Sam, Wrong Way and Red Ball. Levels become progressively harder with more enemies blocking your path and the tiles requiring multiple jumps to change to the required color.Qbert Rebooted takes the arcade classic and catapults it into the 21st century 3D game play that takes full advantage of today’s technologies yet remains faithful to the original Qbert. Featuring hexagonal blocks instead of squares, Qbert Rebooted introduces new enemies, playable characters, power-ups, traps, gem collecting and characters, and new ways to play.Qbert Rebooted highlights:Level Select – replay all previously unlocked levels and track progress against friends.7 New Playable Characters – introducing Qzard, Qbertha, Qbot, Qzilla, Qtee, Qknight and Qnicorn, all based on the original Q*bert form.3 New Enemies – the classic cast of adversaries are joined by new enemies Homer, Uppercut and Treasure Chest9 Achievements – these include Classic Master, Newbert, Qbertorama, Snake Surprise, Green Machine, Ugg!, Down for the Count, Disc Rider  and Coin-Op Collector."

The player takes control of a dynamic ball, and find the music during the gameplay. It is a combination of side-scroller and music. Locations, through which the protagonist passes - are pierced with characteristic rhythms that create the appropriate atmosphere. The player after half an hour of the game can catch himself on what he unconsciously sings the motives from the game to himself.Key featuresBack Hensen, who participated in the development, gave the game three of his compositions - “Cities,” “Touch the People,” and “Spiral Staircase.” Each of them in its own way is played out within the game process. The original execution of the game, intuitive control, as well as uncomplicated but perfectly matched mechanics, making the game a real find for both a music lover and an ordinary player. The feeling of unusual events on the screen does not leave even after the game. There is no multiplayer in the game, but it is unlikely that it can be considered a minus for Sound Shapes."

      "Medal of Honor is a first-person action shooter providing both single and multiplayer experience. It is the thirteenth game in the Medal of Honor franchise, but in comparison to the previous ones, its plot is unique. The game is set in the historical period of the War in Afghanistan. The single campaign opens up in 2001 during the invasion of Afghanistan. The action gives an opportunity to participate in the military conflict for the U.S. Navy. In the course of the storyline, players alternate between the roles of a Navy SEAL operator codenamed Rabbit, Delta Force sniper Deuce, U.S. Army Ranger specialist Dante Adams, and AH-64 Apache gunner Hawk. The gameplay is based on typical military operations including the completion of in-game objectives (raiding enemies’ checkpoints and rescuing hostages). Medal of Honor multiplayer offers a choice of joining one of the conflict’s forces: the Coalition or the Opposing Forces. Each side has its own weapons, however, comparable in general stats. To start a match, the player should choose a class (Rifleman, Special Ops or Sniper). Classes’ equipment and skills can be upgraded with the experience points earned in combat."

      "The third game of the FEAR series of games. The general outline of the whole line of these games is the confrontation of special forces, to be more precise, a soldier named \"Operative\", and a squad of super-soldier clones who refused to obey their superiors. Rebellious clone soldiers are capable of even cannibalism, and other details of the setting correspond to this level of fear.Protagonists and antagonists have unusual abilities or conventional abilities, developed to an unusually high level. This is manifested, among other things, in the possession of ghostly forms, by which it is possible to mislead other people.The game is strictly from the first person. A notable feature of the gameplay is the slow motion mode. In this mode, the player accelerates the perception to such an extent that it can see the flying bullets. This gives him obvious advantages. The slow motion mode, in the game, is explained by the increased content of adrenaline in the blood, which occurs in a person, in a situation that threatens life. If this condition is caused in a natural way, then it does not last long. It can be extended with the help of a special drug, which is included in the number of useful game stuff. Sometimes this mode is \"turned on\" during visions that visit the hero and act on him as much as the danger."

      "Shift 2: Unleashed (Unleashed) Need for Speed: Shift. The sequel expands on many aspects that were introduced in the original.The game offers 148 cars from 36 manufacturers and 35 different tracks on which players can compete in several types of races.The game is not overloaded with plot details, not directly related to car racing. The main character is a novice racer who wants to become a champion - and that’s it!The same approach is seen in many other characteristics of the game. In particular, in the organization of management and in the system of admission to the following levels. Much has been done in these things easier than one might have expected. You need to control different cars in different ways, in full dependence on engine power, front or rear wheel drive, as well as on tuned systems installed on the car, parts and corresponding settings. Even one detail can significantly change the ride.The racetracks in the game do not always repeat their real prototypes. However, all changes in the configuration of the tracks are undertaken in order to make the game more interesting.InnovationsAmong the main innovations of the game are: an in-helmet camera, a hot dog.'Helmet-camera' - allowing you to observe the game through the eyes of a car pilot. The image of this camera, respectively, is completely dependent on the movement of the pilot's head during the race. The camera shakes, tilts when cornering, jerks forward in collisions. And if the car goes at high speeds, the image of the camera simulates the blurring of the field of view, typical of the human vision in similar situations. Finally, if the car and the pilot get into such an accident, in which the camera should break, it breaks and the player’s point of view returns to normal observation.TrainingHey, it’s not a bad idea. champion.In the career mode, players learn driving skills from reputable teachers, with a total of about ten world-class instructors in the game.For example, Vaughn Gittin, a Formula D Champion talks about the career of a pilot in general, how to customize the car, Autolog, teaches how to drift."

When a character's turn comes around, all other characters in the Extended Area of the character in play (and characters in the extended areas of those characters!) can combine in an extended attack.

Once an Item is enhanced to Level 5, you can convert the Item, changing it into something else. This process is irreversible and the original item is lost. Experimentation reveals some great new items!Through Alchemy: Alchemy allows you to combine several items to create a single, more powerful piece of equipment. While you lose the items used in the alchemy, you gain a powerful new piece of equipment and permanent access to your new item in the Shop! Alchemy can create powerful new weapons and armour but occasionally a Smithing Accident will occur and the smith will create a different item than what you expected!The \"Soul Breed\" systemAgarest takes place across 5 generations of heroes, starting with your first character, Leonhardt. During each generation you will build relationships with 3 different female party members, and at the end of each generation's story arc you must choose to marry one of the girls.Your choice of marriage partner is restricted to girls who've grown fond of you over a particular generation. Your options are determined by your choices during conversations at certain points of the story.The girl you choose as your wife - and the strength of their relationship with you - will determine the abilities of the main character in the next generation of the story.

      "Heavy Metal is a way of life and a world in itself, but Eddie Riggs found the real one, after the accident during a concert left him crushed by the scenery and making the involuntary blood sacrifice to the Ormagöden. The action adventure game with the real-time strategy elements in the open world introduced a star voice cast, compiled by musicians that became prototypes for some of the characters players will encounter during the game. Aside from the main story, players will be able to encounter dozens of side missions that may vary from the defense battles to a race. When using his V-guitar named Clementine, Eddie can cast spells, called Solos, by a simple rhythm game, reminiscent of Guitar Hero. Some story missions are so-called Battles of the Bands, where players will fight the armies in a real-time strategy fashion, and winning by outperforming the enemy band and destroying the stage."

      "HOARD is an arcade action game, set in a fantasy world, where the player will take control of a mighty dragon. The game’s overall main goal is to collect treasure for the dragon’s hoard, as the name implies.The gameplay is based around moving through different landscapes, burning down villages, collecting gold troves and kidnapping members of the local royal family, a classic dragon activity. However, the player needs to defend his character’s lair from daring adventurers. Knights set out on a quest of saving the beautiful princess,  and many more creatures with a common goal of defeating the dragon, which would be you. With level progression, players can upgrade different parameters of their scaled protagonist and improve their gold acquiring capabilities. The game offers four game modes, with cooperative multiplayer gradually increasing the difficulty and the overall fun of each playthrough. The graphics are unique in the way where the game field looks like a board game table, with castles and villages placed around differently each time, and the overall look of the game is as if it was a D&D game that suddenly became alive."

      "Sky Force Anniversary is a vertical shoot-em-up game developed by Infinite Drems Inc. It is heavily inspired by the old Japanese arcade machines, like the ones made by Capcom.GameplayThe players have a plane that they use to attack their enemies head-on, evading return fire. Multiple planes are present in the game, with each one of them having their own stats and gameplay. Every player will be able to find their favorite pick. The primary objective of each level is to get to its end without getting blown up by enemy planes, as most enemy shots are fatal. The levels consist of a mix of challenging and easy moments with the difficulty rising with each encounter. There are several boss fights present in the game. There are also several side objectives. Usually, there are four of them: destroying 70% of the enemies, 100% of the enemies, saving all the people present on the level, completing the level without getting any damage.Sky Force Anniversary features a very balanced economic system. The players are awarded stars upon destroying an enemy plane. These stars serve as an in-game currency. It is used for upgrading your plane or purchasing new ones. The amount of stars awarded to the player depends on the chosen level difficulty.Unlike the previous title, Sky Force 2014, Sky Force Anniversary is not a free-to-play title. Thus it does not rely on microtransactions in its gameplay."

The agent Michael Thorton is assigned to investigate the case. He manages to get on the trail of the leader of the group, but suddenly he is removed from the job and betrayed by senior colleagues. Now, when the American government hunted him, Michael uses \"Alpha Protocol\" - a secret program that recruited him and begins to work to detect the conspiracy secretly.Alpha Protocol gives you the ability to take control of Thorton with a camera from a third-person perspective (you can see all that surrounds you). The CIA trained Thorton, so at his disposal is possession of weapons of ranged and melee, as well as technical devices. The player also earns promotion points, which increase skills in using guns and give additional abilities. Alpha Protocol provides the ability to interact with numerous characters in the game. Conversations take place in real time, thus giving to the player some time to answer in essential dialogues."

She has to start a battle for herself - for the self that she does not even remember.Setting, plot, design and lighting immediately evokes a masterpiece of cyberpunk - «Blade Runner». But the game is noticeably superior to the movie regarding «volume» of space, the sensation of «air» and «presence» in the game. There is an impression that you see the world of the game 360 ​​degrees around you. Mimicry and plastic of characters are directed in each detail, undoubtedly dramatic, give a full impression of a play of live actors. It seems that even the movements of inanimate objects are filled with the same expressiveness - for example, the trajectories of a thrown pistol or splinters ... High level of directing and corresponding levels of design and graphics. A mass of significant finds, filling every frame with emotion and senses."

It features an open-world ancient Persian city-state, that is fully available for the players.At the heart of the game this time is not a fictional plot, but real Persian mythology. According to one of the legends, the god Ariman spewed out dark energy onto the Persian land. And the hero is to liberate it from this. This time, the main character has a trust-worthy sidekick. It is controlled by a AI and the interaction of two characters builds the basic gameplay mechanics.The world of the game will have to travel a lot in the empty game world: the whole 24 levels of the game are populated with fewer than 10 NPCs. But hands down: visually they look like an illustration from the ancient Persian book. Acrobatic stunts were reinvented and the movement of the main character now feels more fluid and natural."

It is rather difficult to maintain a high level of games every year, but it worked out in the sixth part of the series. The game continues the storyline of the previous part.The game consists of numerous fast-paced gunfights. Classic hit points are not here anymore - after receiving damage, the player only needs to sit tight in safety waiting for health to come back. There are three game modes: the story campaign, multiplayer and Spec Ops. If there are almost no changes in the campaign, and this is the same linear story, the Spec Ops includes 23 new levels for single or cooperative completion. Each level is a new task, a new challenge whether it is the defusing a bomb or the elimination of enemy forces. Levels are divided into tiers by their complexity.As in any other game of the series, the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 takes a special place. Each match is a mission, for which you need to come up with new strategies to complete. As in the past, new weapons and perks are opened for the execution of tasks."

Created by industry luminary Warren Spector and Disney Interactive’s Junction Point game  development studio, Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two returns the franchise through PC. Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two returns Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit to  Wasteland, an alternate world filled with 80 years of forgotten Disney characters and theme park  attractions.  But for the first time, Mickey and Oswald will join forces as true partners – Mickey with his  magical paint brush that wields paint and thinner, and Oswald with his powerful remote control that  allows him to command electricity.   This new co-op play combined with enhanced in-game physics will  further enhance the idea that “PlayStyle Matters” – a unique approach to gameplay pioneered by  Warren Spector where players dynamically tackle different challenges in order to explore all possibilities  and storylines, but with consequences for their chosen actions."

Walking by foot consumes more time and strength, but driving a car forces the player to buy fuel and compensate for repairs.The game also features combat mechanics — the player may use the melee weapons and firearms against the forces of another world. The latter, however, cannot catch sight of them if they get a hold of their breath.The story follows the investigation of the murder of Anna Graham,. The events depicted take place in the universe in which good and evil intentions may be shared within the world by the messengers."

    "about": [
      "Dante's Inferno is a slasher role-playing game developed by Visceral game.PlotThe game is loosely based on the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The players control Dante, a veteran of crusades, looks for his beloved Beatrice who got taken by Lucifer. As Dante descends deeper into Hell, he has to face more and more horrific creatures, his own sins and the dark history of his family.GameplayThe gameplay of Dante's Inferno is similar to most slayer games. The core mechanics of the genre are to control a character who traverses different locations and eliminates every enemy they find on their path (demons in this case). The protagonist's weapons are long-ranged, allowing for the mass murder of their enemies. The boss battles in the game are heavily inspired by God of War, where the player firstly fights with the boss and later uses a quick-time event to finish their enemy off. Multiple platforming puzzles are present in the game. The levels itself consist of multiple interconnected platforms. There are numerous spots where the players have to jump to, not without using their weapons on several occasions. Two weapons are present in the game: the Death's Scythe and a Holy Cross, which differ both in their usage and their role in the game's character progression system. Both weapons have their own upgrade trees which require souls. Souls can be acquired by killing enemies with one of the weapons."

    "title": "Call of Juarez: Gunslinger",
    "about": [
      "Gunslinger is the fourth installment of the Call of Juarez series of western-inspired games. The frame story, told in cutscenes, begins in 1910, in Kansas, where Silas, a patron in the pub, brags about his adventures in the Wild West. This old man claims he used to be a bounty hunter who took down many of the famous outlaws. Most of the game has the player re-enacting Silas's presumed past, while in the present the hero is narrating his own story off-screen. Silas is an unreliable narrator, however, and his own in-game audience will point at plot holes in his tall tales. Like the rest of Call of Juarez games, Gunslinger has every classic staple of the western genre. There are saloons and gold mines, stagecoaches, Indians and cowboys, sheriffs and gangs. The protagonist will escape prison, wander the Wild West, fight brigands and other enemies using a variety of late XIX century firearms, and occasionally sing country songs. Gunfights and duels are the central features of the game. There's even a Duel mode, in which the player can enter a tournament of gun duels, and the Arcade mode, in which multiple opponents attack the player. Gunslinger also introduces quick time events that allow the player to evade bullets."

    "title": "Duke Nukem Forever",
    "about": [
      "Duke Nukem is a larger-than-life macho who smokes cigars, speaks in one-liners, and has a kink for hot girls and big guns. Twelve years ago, Duke defeated invading aliens and became a worldwide celebrity, but now another invasion forces him to go out of retirement. He has to save all the Earth's women, who are being kidnapped by aliens. Most weapons are the same as in the original game. However, this time Duke cannot carry all his arsenals and is restricted to only two weapons at a time. He can also use “holoduke”, a holographic version of himself, to distract enemies. Duke restores his health over time using a new mechanic of “ego bar” — a measurement of Duke’s enormous ego that needs to be bolstered.This belated sequel to Duke Nukem 3D spent 15 years in development, so it may feel like an artifact from another era. This is especially obvious from the game’s vulgar black humor. The protagonist may urinate, drink beer, and tell somewhat chauvinistic jokes about women. There's also controversial Capture the Babe multiplayer mode, based on \"capture the flag\", but instead of flags, there are girls that have to be spanked."

      "The sixth game in a series of action-packed books/games about special forces from the maestro of the genre Tom Clancy. The plot of the game has nothing to do with the previous parts. The story tells of a new team that was relocated to Las Vegas to defeat international terrorist grouping led by Irena Morales, which attacks different parts of the city.There were specific changes in the gameplay: now the player does not have a standard health meter, to restore strength you need to catch your breath in cover. A third-person camera was added, it is involved in shooting from the shelter. The game uses a checkpoint system, and there are almost no cutscenes. The whole story is told with the help of the display on the helmet of the operative.To complete the story missions, the player needs to plan the attack on the Rainbow Six and help with its execution. Resist the attack will be wiser than in the past parts of the AI. In addition to the story campaign, multiplayer is available."

Both sides are making their way through fights, fighting live opponents, drones and turrets.Each level adds value to the capabilities of the entire team - adds strength to attacks and health. At the beginning of the game, all these indicators are equal to 1, and by the end reach 20.The game space includes health packages and Solar units - it is a currency that has circulation inside the game. The currency is added to each member of the team at each destruction of the enemy - regardless of who exactly the enemy destroyed. The accumulation of currency opens up other characters and the possibility of their customisation. Destroying the turret gives the team a super-drone, which is very useful when attacking an enemy base."

      "Rock of Ages is a game which resembles a racing game, a Tower Defence and a platformer at the same time. It was developed by ACE Team.The game is loosely based on the myth of Sisyphus. The main objective of the player is to use a giant boulder in order to destroy the enemy castle located at the bottom of the hill while at the same time defending your own stronghold using various structures. Players can build money farms to raise the funds necessary to build defensive structures or upgrade the boulder itself. After gathering a certain amount of money it is possible to equip both defensive and offensive upgrades to the boulder. The enemies can destroy the boulder in which case the player has to wait until the boulder spawns again and proceed with the offense. The player wins if they successfully destroy the enemy's castle gates and place the boulder right in the center of the castle. There are five distinctive time periods present in the game, such as romanticism, rococo, renaissance, and so on."

    "title": "Abyss Odyssey",
    "about": [
      "Abyss Odyssey is an action platformer game developed by the ACE Team. The game also features several roguelike elements.PlotThe game follows several heroes that descend into the dungeons of a 19th century Chile city of Santiago to find a warlock, whose dreams wreck havoc on the streets of a South American town.GameplayIn its gameplay, Abyss Odyssey fuses several genres into one, creating something absolutely new. The players control a character, whose main objective is to complete procedurally generated levels without dying and killing as many monsters as they can on the way to the exit from the level. The implementation of procedural generation results in a high degree of replayability as no level will play out the same.Due to the infusion of roguelike elements to the game, the players only have one life. Upon death, the players are given a weaker character to play as. This new character sets out to avenge the death of a previous one. It is possible to revive your dead character by finding them and using a special alter that has to be found somewhere on the level. The game's combat is heavily inspired by several Japanese fighting games. The players are awarded new loot upon timing their moves correctly. Abyss Odyssey features a unique level unlock system, that is driven by the community. On the game's release, only the first act was available for playing. The next ones were unlocked upon a certain number of players beating the game's bosses."

      "The direct sequel to Shank (2010). The main protagonist, Shank, is a former mafia hitman. His home country is taken over by a military coup led by ruthless General Magnus, and Shank has no choice but to fight the regime's militia. There's also a second protagonist, Shank's childhood friend Corina. She can be played in several story missions, as well as in a newly introduced multiplayer survival mode. Corina's abilities are slightly different from that of Shank's, her moves are swifter, however, her attacks deal less damage.The game is played as a 2D side-scroller. To move forward, Shank and Corina have to defeat all enemies they encounter, using three types of weapons: piercing them with knives, smashing with a club or shooting with a gun. The weapons can be switched on a fly during the action, thus allowing a variety of combos. The gameplay has slightly changed since the original game: blocking is not allowed anymore, and dodging is the only option to evade damage. Like its predecessor, Shank 2 features a somewhat cartoonish visual style, that contrasts the quite bloody and grotesque action scenes."

    "title": "Hydrophobia: Prophecy",
    "about": [
      "Hydrophobia Prophecy is an improved version of the game Hydrophobia, designed for the PlayStation 3 and Steam. Hydrophobia Prophecy includes both new levels (updated approximately 70% of the content) and levels already exist, but have undergone significant processing.Both the original and the reworked version of the game are created as part of the action-adventure genre with elements of survival horror in the cyberpunk style.Place and time of actionThe game takes place in the middle of the XXI century. By this time, the world is plunged into chaos caused by great overpopulation. Lands suitable for food production are destroyed by rising ocean levels and the spread of deserts. Hunger and misery reign in the world. The most precious resource of humanity in these conditions is simple drinking water.The game takes place on board a giant cruise liner comparable in size to the city. The liner is called Queen of the World, it was built by a group of giant corporations to create comfortable conditions for the elected representatives from among the managers of these corporations.HistoryAt the very beginning of the game, a group of terrorists is attacking and seizing a ship. The terrorists call themselves \"Neo Malthusians\" (after the economist Thomas Malthus, who predicted the death of humanity from overpopulation). They plan to kill many people so that the world will return to a state fit for a full life. Attacking the liner, the terrorists painted the walls with their slogans, the same slogans are broadcast on screens all over the ship. One of the slogans: “Save the World - Kill Yourself!”.The terrorists are attacking a diner to get a tool for global genocide, killing about 10 billion people - such tools are in the secret laboratories of one of the Five Corporations located on the liner - “NanoCell Corporation”.The protagonist, system engineer of the ship Kate Wilson, was responsible for the safety of the liner - when as a result of an attack by terrorists the ship begins to sink, Kate seeks to survive and tries to prevent the terrorists. What she needs for this, too, is in these secret laboratories.GameplayOne of the creators of the game described the gameplay as a “player against the environment”, meaning, first of all, water - water constantly interacts with everything it comes in contact with, and it gives an incredible variety of situations, sets of options for changing circumstances.Water floods the liner, constantly changing the configuration of spaces suitable for action and movement. The player must constantly adapt to this and respond quickly.Other characters can also affect the situation, and this effect also leads to a redistribution and movement of water. Water may involve other objects and substances in its actions — for example, a gasoline stain that has spread through water may ignite and burn, while water carries these fiery stains throughout the ship.The action can occur both on the surface of the water and in its thickness.HydroEngine, an engine capable of solving this problem with unprecedented realism, was created to simulate flowing water in all its variety for the game."

    "title": "Rise of the Argonauts",
    "about": [
      "The role modelReleased in 2008, the game, is similar to another well-known representative of the genre of action-role-playing games God of War series. Developers became studio Liquid Entertainment, and the publisher company Codemasters. The game appeared on the PC and on the most popular consoles of its generation: Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.The story and the settingThe plot of the game tells about Jason, and the action takes place in Ancient Greece. Like God of War, the game uses ancient Greek mythology to build a game universe. The modified myth of Jason and the Argonauts, who went on a journey for the Golden Fleece was used as inspiration. According to the scriptwriters of the game, Jason is a Greek king, whose wife was killed in front of him. The only way for a grieving husband to return the beloved is the Golden Fleece, which can resurrect the dead. Other well-known heroes of myths appear in the game: Hercules, Achilles, Medea, Medusa, Patroclus, and others. Together they travel through a variety of real and imaginary locations: Iolcu, Delphi, Mycenae, Tartar, and Kifr.Key featuresThe game consists of a large number of dialogues and enemies confrontations on vast, detailed levels. In contrast to God of War, critics point out simple battles with bosses and the strange arrangement of enemies on each level, which also simplifies the gameplay. You can use a sword as a weapon, a spear, and a mace is also available. Each weapon has its own characteristics and offers different gameplay: the mace breaks shields, but can not cope with a large number of enemies, the sword reduces the player's defense capabilities, but increases the effectiveness of melee combat, etc. In addition to these weapons, you can upgrade Jason skills on four branches: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. Points for upgrades the player receives as the tasks are completed and for the correct answers in the dialogs."

Singleplayer allows the player to switch between characters while in the cooperative the figure is tied to the gamer. Trine 2 features bright and shiny middle-aged levels with the essential elements glowing in the location.

    "about": [
      "Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate - Deluxe Edition is an action-adventure game developed by Armature Studios. It is the direct continuation of Batman: Arkham Origins and is a canon installment of the Batman: Arkham series.PlotThree months after his first encounter with Joker, Bruce Wayne comes across the Catwoman who stole documents from a secret government organization. She is put in the Blackgate prison with the help of Batman. Two weeks later, the prisoners attempt an escape. The prison's staff is taken hostage, and the security detail is dead. Catwoman agrees to help Batman save the hostages.GameplayUnlike the Arkham game series, Blackgate is a 2.5-dimensional game, like Metroid and Castlevania. However, the game does not use any features of such dimension and plays out like a usual 2D title. The Protagonist walks from right to left clearing the prison out, saving the staff, and completing side-quests like finding items. Items can be detected using Batman's Detective Vision. When Batman walks into a new area of the prison, there a chance of encountering a group of prisoners, which will attack him. All the enemies, apart from bosses, require two or three hits to be knocked out. Most of the game's fights can be avoided by using stealth. When the player clears a certain area of the prison out, it will remain clear of enemies until the end of the game."

      "The game that started the popular Crysis series. You control a member of Delta Force special military squad, codenamed Nomad. Your squad was sent to rescue a group of American archeologists who are about to be imprisoned by North Korea. The archeologists recently made a world-changing discovery that needs to be protected by any means. Soon it turns out your real enemy is not North Koreans, but rather something not from this world. The plot is told partly through cutscenes, but mostly through in-game events that the player participates in.All Delta Force soldiers are equipped with super-powered futuristic Nanosuits, which are the trademark feature of Crysis series. The Nanosuits provide four types of powers that can (and should) be switched on a fly during battles. \"Strenght\" enhances the wearer's abilities in melee combat, \"Armor\" protects him from the damage, \"Speed\" allows you to move faster, and \"Cloak\" renders you almost invisible to opponents. Besides the story mode, there are two multiplayer modes that allow up to 32 players to participate. Instant Action mode is a traditional deathmatch, while Power Struggle mode features two teams (designed to look like American and North Korean) trying to destroy each other’s bases."

The game is set in a fictional megapolis called the Empire City.  The player assumes the role of Cole MacGrath, a regular delivery man who miraculously survived a deadly explosion that destroyed much of the city. This trauma somehow gave Cole a superhuman power to control electricity. His powers can be used to move, attack and defend, and over the course of the game, he will discover a lot of new abilities. The powers are not infinite, and Cole needs to be charged with more electricity. It depends on you if MacGrath will use them for the greater good or becomes a villain. Every choice he makes in the game will affect his Karma, making him more Good or Evil. The central plot, however, does not depend on your Karma meter and only varies based on certain player actions. Because of his high electric charge, the protagonist cannot drive vehicles. MacGrath moves around the town on feet, often climbing up the roofs and using his parkour skills."

      "Fallout 3 is a legendary action RPG, which continues the Fallout franchise. Players dive into the events held 36 years after Fallout 2's ending. The game is set in the post-apocalyptic open world known as the “Capital Wasteland.” According to the storyline, by 2277, the whole familiar world finds itself devastated. The cataclysm is the consequence of the nuclear war of 2077 between USA and China. The only people left on Earth are lucky ones, who managed to stay alive on the surface, and those, who made their way to the warehouses provided by Vaul-Tech (like the main character). In the very beginning, the protagonist wakes up inside the Vault 101. His only aim is to find his father who left the warehouse some time ago. On his way, he will contact other survivors (both gangs and singles) and explore entire restoring areas of Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, and Maryland. The game offers countless progress opportunities, so the gameplay is overloaded with various features including types of customization, numerous conversations with NPC’s, side quests – everything that an average player is going to face."

    "about": [
      "Worms Revolution is a Team17 game and the 18th part of Worms series, counting as many as 25 titles total. It is the turn-based game with a heavy accent on customizable characters and environment. The game features single- and multiplayer while giving the players an opportunity to play in cooperative with the hotseat feature allowing them to take turns one at a time.It is hard to say that \"Worms\" has any plot at all: there is barely even hints, which may prompt the player to understand the eternal conflict between the worms of a different color. The gameplay, on the other hand, is quite memorable: in fact so crucial that not only Worms have given birth to many other worms-like games but also created a whole genre: artillery tactical turn-based strategy. The primary goal of a team or a player is to eliminate the opponent(s). To achieve this goal, one must utilize a various range of weapons. They do not only damage the other worms but also transform the ground. While every turn grants the player with the ability to walk a certain amount of space and utilize one weapon — the landscape factor is crucial here."

Eventually, players will be tasked to find the first piece, of the Vault Key.By being a story-driven first-person shooter with RPG elements, Borderlands allows adjusting the playstyle by finding different weapons, leveling up the character and improving some skills or attributes. Cooperative in nature, Borderlands can be played with up to 3 other players in total, where players can take the roles of 4 different characters: Brick the Berserker, Mordecai the Hunter, Lilith the Siren and Roland the Soldier. Some characters are naturally proficient in specific weapons, but players are not constricted to the skill requirements. When a specific weapon type is used often – the more proficient players are. Borderlands have several story DLCs that either shift the tone of the main game or expand on the existing storyline and characters."

      "Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City, as a part of the GTA franchise, offers players an open-world action with countless signs of immorality and violence. Although Episodes from LC is not a direct sequel to the series, it is slightly connected with the original GTA IV. Despite having the same game setting as in the previous GTA chapter (the action takes place in Liberty City approximately at the same time), the city itself faces some cosmetic changes. Several new details (new vehicles, weaponry and mini-games) were also added to the gameplay. The game also has better graphics and optimization. Episodes gives players an opportunity to dive into the atmosphere of crime, which Liberty City is famous for. The game includes two separate storylines: The Lost and Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony. In The Lost and Damned players take control of Johnny, a member of brutal biker gang The Lost, who has to fight against rival gangs for control of a city. Ballad of Gay Tony experiences playing for Luis Lopez, who tries to find himself in the world full of violence and obscenity."

      "Dragon Rising is the second installment of Operation Flashpoint series, though its plot bears no connection to the previous game. The game is set on Skira, a fictional Northern Pacific island with huge oil reserves. China annexed the island, provoking a military conflict with Russia and the US. Skira’s landscape is thoroughly modeled after a real-life Kiska island in Russia. The player assumes the role of a leader in a squad of four US soldiers, three of which are AI-controlled. In the single-player campaign, they perform a series of military operations against the Chinese army. The gameplay tries to authentically simulate the real warfare, with no checkpoints and few scripted scenes. Depending on the difficulty level, the player may even lack the traditional HUD indications of health, ammo, and directions. The player will have to march long distances through the 35 km wide Skira, which may feel like a slog, but also adds to the game’s realism.There are many multiplayer modes in Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. The players can assume the roles of the remaining three soldiers to play through the main campaign. There's also a local PvP mode and a couple of traditional online multiplayer modes."

    "about": [
      "A series, that brought players several notable titles, was mostly set in 2D because artillery turn-based games have a set of mechanics that compliment the closed maps and complicated terrain. But Worms Ultimate Mayhem is a modernized remake of the different direction, taken by the Team 17. This game is a direct remake of Worms 4: Mayhem, expanding the movement mechanics to the 3D environments.Worms Ultimate Mayhem adds several features to the typical Worms gameplay. Each player controls a team of 4 or fewer worms and can control one worm at a time, moving around, using items and attacking in a set amount of time. Then after each player moved and attacked in turn with all of their characters round starts over, and the game goes until only one player or a team left. There’s an option for players to play a single player campaign and challenges, from the previous Worms 3D games, or a match against bots with an improved AI. But any Worms have multiplayer modes, both local and online, with ranked matches. Each worm team can be customized with names, voices, hats, signature weapon, taunts and tombstones. Added in-game voice chats and real-time lighting, shaders and post process effects are adding to the improved design and comfortability."

      "A rare opportunity to so wholly quench the thirst for total destruction. The game understands this desire and does everything to make it happen. Yes, there is a story in the game, but the main thing is that there are tremendous opportunities to see on the screen a bright consequence of all your destructive impulses.Your small car or helicopter rushes around the locations, bringing down the streams of fire. The game reality is repeatedly and colourfully detonated from every touch. The game continually offers more and more appetising victims - cars, flying and swimming devices, limousines and buildings, which can be destroyed entirely or in pieces, inflicting wounds one by one or killing with one blow.It is clear that you are busy with all these mass destructions so you cannot observe the rules of the road - the game is favourably treated with the manner of your car to fly into a skid or to demolish fences not only by guns but also by bumpers. Navigation and management are also skillfully designed - and intended to not to distract you from the massacre."

To earn extra money you can perform multiple tricks, including drifts, jumps, near-misses, and combos of these moves. Driving through the city isn’t that easy as it seems to be.

GameplayThe player explores a vast map by running and climbing surfaces. There are second to none enemies and hostile NPCs. Rooms bound the world in the title. There are a total of 1800 rooms in total. The protagonist can take quests from NPCs and explore the game's world according to his likings.PlotThe depicted actions take place on the planet abandoned by humans 500 years ago. The player follows the adventures of Mi Sprocket in the world inhabited by sprites, fairies, and other fantasy creatures. She does not talk, so everyone confuses her request for making a wish to the local shrine for saving the world. She sets off on the adventure with two fairies of her kind: Cilia and Dora. Fairies have different personalities so it matters which one is sent to talk with NPCs as it may affect the outcome of the negotiations. The foremost fairies' quest is to find Six Bells of Fate — only after ringing the all would there be a world's order and the destruction of the universe would be canceled.Knytt utilizes breaking the fourth wall with exploiting favorite game clichés — disguising in-game characters as the real people and making fun of the main quest which seems to have no meaning."

      "Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD takes the best elements of the classic THPS games and gives them a fresh update to create an all new skateboarding experience for PC. The gameplay in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD focuses on the satisfaction of linking sick tricks for maximum points. Combining sharp visuals with the best controls ever in a Tony Hawk game, the feel is cutting edge yet timeless.Key FeaturesTHPS and THPS2 gameplay comes to PC!HD Upgrade: Game was rebuilt and polished by Robomodo using Neversoft’s original level models.Classic levels: The style and feel of the best 7 levels from THPS and THPS2 (Warehouse, School 2, Mall, Hangar, Venice, Marseille and Phoenix Downhill Jam) refreshed for today. The levels are exactly the same specs as the originals - every gap, SKATE Letter, etc is exactly where you remember it but looks a hell of a lot better!The Top Pros: Today’s biggest skate pros round out the cast including: Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, Eric Koston, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Riley Hawk and, of course, Tony Hawk himself. Each has 8 boards, 3 special moves, and an alternate outfit.Refined controls: The skaters’ animations, tricks and combos reflect the evolution of the THPS games. Animations are improved, the tricks have been redone (and some new special tricks added), even “skater celebrations” have been added for big combos.Manuals and Reverts: You can do manuals as part of trick combos in THPS HD. Given the fact that this game combines the best gameplay from THPS1 and THPS2, Reverts will not work as part of trick combos in the initial launch of THPS HD as that mechanic was not introduced until THPS3. However, reverts will work in the post-release DLC for the THPS3 levels, as those levels were originally designed to accommodate this.Endlessly fun objectives:  Players pursue the same global and level-specific goals as the original games, including S-K-A-T-E, Secret DVD (used to be VHS tape!), and many more.In-Game Soundtrack: It is about half classic THPS tracks and half new ones. Includes Goldfinger’s “Superman” and the Anthrax/Public Enemy collaboration “Bring the Noise”.Downloadable content: Coming post-release, The “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 HD Revert Pack” DLC includes levels from THPS3 including Airport, Canada, and LA. New pros included are legends Steve Caballero and Geoff Rowley.In Game Map View: Pause and see the location of objectives and gaps.Quick Restart: Back button allows you to quickly restart their session. Perfect for the obsessive gamer who is looking to achieve the perfect combo."

PlotAll the music in the world got stolen. Only the player can recover the music by using the last 18 tracks that were saved by humanity.GameplayJust like in Dance Dance Revolution, the gameplay of KickBeat relies on the player pushing one out for four prompted buttons at the right time. Enemies come at the player from four directions, and by pressing the buttons, the player character attacks them in the right direction. All the action corresponds with the beat of a current playing song. By pressing the correct buttons, the players create a unique fight scene.Despite having its own soundtrack, the players can import their own music into the game, just like in Audiosurf. There are 11 artists with 24 songs featured in the Special Edition of the game, with Celldweller, Pendulum, and Styles of Beyond featured in it.The game is also inspired by the classic Hong Kong Kung Fu flicks, with all the character animations being hand-drawn to ensure the best quality possible. To focus the player's attention on the on-screen action, the developers got rid of action prompts and replaced them with well-made 3D characters."

    "about": [
      "Mighty No. 9 is a sci-fi game that strongly resembles the classic Mega Man series.PlotThe main protagonist is Beck, a battle android from the Mighty Numbers series (his number is 9). A virus attack led to a machine uprising, and Mighty No. 9 is among the few robots that were not infected. His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason. He will also assimilate their data to send it back to the lab so that Dr. White could find the cure for the virus. Beck is occasionally assisted by Call, a female robot unaffected by the virus.GameplayThe player controls Beck in a 2D environment. Like in Mega Man, the protagonist jumps platforms and fires a gun. Beck can also use the special acceleration ability that allows him to leap long distances and through his enemies. By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up. The type of a power-up depends on the color of a Xel: red gives Beck more powerful attacks, green speeds him up, yellow improves his stamina, and blue heals him. Gathering Xel from Mighty Numbers, Beck receives new special abilities.MultiplayerThe game includes a cooperative multiplayer for two, in which the second player controls Call. Her gameplay is very different and is largely defensive as she uses deflector shields to protect herself and Beck."

      "Mafia II is the second game in the franchise about Italian mafia operating in America after World War II. Vito Scalleta returns from the war in Italy being wounded. As he returns and reunites with his friend Joe, he and Henry Tomassino convince Vito to be apart of an Italian mafia in fictional city Empire Bay. Starting to work for Alberto Clemente, Vito must go through every aspect of being a part of the family and become a big thing in it.Even though the game has an open world mechanic, you won't probably explore it. Travelling to missions give an opportunity to listen to music of this time in America - Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Dean Martin and others, providing the game with a great atmosphere of the USA in its 50s. The gameplay has a variety of missions to offer, in which you can confront your enemies in melee combat, shoot them with different guns like M1911 or Thompson, or stealthily engaging your opponents. The game is pretty strict to the player reaching highest of empathy with Vito and every situation he's in."

    "about": [
      "Tom Clancy's HAWX (high-altitude warfare) promises to revolutionize the way players think about combat in the sky. The story begins in the year 2012. As the era of the nation-state draws quickly to a close, the rules of warfare evolve even more rapidly. More and more nations become increasingly dependent on private military companies (PMCs), elite mercenaries with a lax view of the law. The Reykjavik Accords further legitimize their existence by authorizing their right to serve in every aspect of military operations. While the benefits of such PMCs are apparent, growing concerns surrounding giving them too much power begin to mount. The Enhanced Reality System is the backbone of the HAWX flight experience: radars and incoming missile detection, anti-crash system, damage control system, tactical map and information relay, and weapons trajectory control. E.R.S. also allows players to issue orders to their squadron, making this system as iconic to HAWX as the Cross-Com system is to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. Players can ease into their flight missions and gain a level of comfort with the use of the assistance mode. Once employed, players can take full advantage of their technological support through the E.R.S and gain maximum piloting security. If the situation calls for the player to unleash the full potential of the aircraft, the assistance mode can be switched off and all safety features will be deactivated. For the first time ever in the air-combat genre, players can experience the entire solo campaign in four-player JUMP IN co-op mode. In PVP mode, players can challenge up to 15 friends in intense dogfighting sessions and find out who's the top gun. Winning players are rewarded with experience points and money to unlock more weapons. Players have the opportunity to take the throttle of over 50 of the world's most famous aircrafts, as well as being able to dogfight over realistic modern landscapes that have endured years of post-war trauma."

The protagonist becomes a commander of the order of The Gray Knights which acquire a manor in their protectorate. The players arrive at the castle, where the creatures of the Darkness still attack humans even after the murder of their leader. The Knights find information that several Darkness creatures became sentient and began their investigation.GameplayThe game's core mechanics are largely the same as the base game with several additions. Now the players have to take care of the land in their possession, making decisions about building up new defenses (by looking for ores and purchasing new buildings). The story takes 10 to 15 hours to complete. There are many side quests present in the game apart from the main story. Unlike the base game, you cannot romance any of the Knights as there is no love story whatsoever in the expansion pack.The players are free to create whatever character they like, but the story does not depend as much as it did on the player character's race. There are three specializations with several classes in them. That makes it very easy for the players to create a character to fit their own playstyle."

      "Jet Set Radio (2000) is an action game that allows players to dive into the atmosphere of teenager gangs of early 2000s Tokyo. The action is set in a 3D fictionalized Tokyo torn by teen gangs clash. Things clarify when Professor K, DJ of the Tokyo-to pirate radio station announces a gang war between Japanese rudies (teenagers, who skate and paint graffiti for self-expression). According to the main idea, teens skate and paint graffiti spots throughout the city and dodge police forces. The story is following a 17-year-old rudie Beat, who, being inspired by Professor K, organizes his own gang to burst into the conflict and to defeat rivals. The gameplay is about skating across the city (using only a few buttons) and tagging all possible graffiti spots. In the course of the game, players will face troubles caused by police riots and especially Capitan Onishima (the main antagonist), whose only aim is to pursue the rebellion of the youth. Jet Set Radio also features cel-shaded visuals in favor of 3D cartoon-like picture."

      "MotorStorm Apocalypse is a racing game developed by Evolution Studios. It is the third installment in the MotorStorm series.SettingYou take part in The Festival, an extreme racing event that takes place in a post-apocalyptic San-Francisco. The city is torn apart by devastating earthquakes. There are no civilians left in the town, apart from scavengers and the PMCs sent to maintain at least some degree of order. GameplayThe Festival consists of three categories of events which are different in their difficulty. For every race, the player has to choose a vehicle from a pre-determined class. Buggies, motorcycles, and cars are present in the game. Players are free to tune and customize their vehicles as they see fit. The game features an advanced damage model. After sustaining a certain amount of damage, the cars crash and explode. Every vehicle can use a boost for a limited amount of time. If the player boosts for too long, the car can blow up. The car's engine can be cooled off to use a bit more boost. The inhabitants of San-Fran will attempt to interfere into the races. The scavengers try to slam the racers off the road using stolen cars or shoot at them while the PMCs create additional hazards for the participants of The Festival, such as an attack helicopter. Players have to keep in mind that the city is still vulnerable to natural disasters with buildings crumbling down on their heads."

Further into the game upgrades for the plane are unlocked, such as new weapons, body kits, and engines. There is 125 plane builds available in the game. The build the player uses affects the music player in the game. Every plane subsystem brings something new into the game's music. The main objective of the player is to survive against the enemies overwhelming force, which includes reactive and experimental planes, zeppelins, boats, ships, subs and so on. A scoring system is also present in the game. Upon the enemies destruction, the player gains a score multiplier."

The Third Echelon got disbanded, and Sam Fischer became a private security contractor. A terrorist organization known as The Engineers threatens the United States with a series of terrorist attacks if the U.S. Military will not call off their troops stationed in other countries. POTUS comes to Fischer, forms the Fourth Echelon and grants Sam with a Fifth Freedom - the freedom to defend the four first freedoms no matter what it takes.GameplaySplinter Cell Blacklist focuses on a stealth mission approach.

It is also possible to upgrade Fisher's outfit, making it more stealthy or improve its armor. The players can also upgrade their HQ to gain certain advantages on the battlefield, such as an improved minimap.The game evaluates the players' performance. Three play styles are available - Ghost, a complete stealth approach with no kills; Panther - a stealthy approach with enemy kills; Assault - a head-on gunfight with the enemies."

      "This sequel to American McGee's Alice follows the protagonist, Alice Lidell, as she returns to the dark world of her subconsciousness, the nightmarish version of Lewis Carrol’s Wonderland. After she was released from the psychiatric asylum, Alice moved to the orphanage, where she’s being treated with the use of hypnosis. It doesn't stop her from descending again into the grotesque realm of disturbing visuals, creepy music, and absurdist logic. She will again meet the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, and many other darker versions of Carrol’s whimsy characters. Her journey through the Wonderland serves as a metaphor for Alice fighting her own madness.The game is played in the third-person view. On her way, Alice will jump the platforms, solve puzzles, and fight enemies. The combat system allows for a seamless flow of attacks, dodges, and combos. Besides her trademark Vorpal Blade, Alice will use other, somewhat surreal weapons, such as Teapot Cannon, Clockwork Bomb, or Pepper Grinder. In the sequel, Alice gains a new ability called Hysteria that can be activated when her health is the lowest."

The game is set in the space environment of the future. The story of the second part begins in 2511, 3 years after the events held in the first game. The main character Isaac Clarke is awakened after 3-year coma (after the escape from Aegis VII) in an insane asylum in the Sprawl on Titan. A soon as the event pace raises and antagonists start pursuing him to get his brains (for building a new Marker), Isaac realizes his only goal – the destruction of the Marker. Players are offered to join the protagonist’s space adventures to complete his main mission and to force a Necromorph outbreak. As in the previous part, Isaac uses a special Resource Integration Gear – special suit, which displays important in-game parameters including health and oxygen level (required for vacuum spaces), and which also serves as a gameplay HUD. In case if one of the scales reaches the zero point, Isaac will die, and the game will be restarted from the last checkpoint."

    "about": [
      "Skate 3 is a skateboarding simulator developed by EA Black Box. It is the third game in the series and is a direct sequel to Skate 2.PlotThe game takes place sometime later after the events of Skate 2. The main protagonist, who is now known as The Legend, became one of the best skaters. He travels to a coastal town of Port Carventer to take part in a sponsored event but fails. To get to the top again, he has to put up his own team.GameplayPort Carventer differs a lot from San Vanselona. There are no zones where skating is restricted. The city itself consists of three zones: The City, The University, and the Industrial Area. Each zone has its own differences, for example, there are a lot of monuments and concrete buildings in The City, while The University boasts a high number of open spaces.Like in previous installments, the game's core mechanic called Flick It is still present in the game and is essential for getting high scores. It gives the player control of the skater and maps it to the right stick of the gamepad. Players are given points for doing tricks. The amount of points depends on the difficulty of the trick and their combos. The game offers three difficulty settings: Easy (you can jump higher and do tricks faster), Normal (a classic difficulty, like in previous games of the series), and Hardcore (the physics resembles the same of the real world). There is an in-depth tutorial called Skate.school that is accessible at any point in the game."

    "about": [
      "Shift is the thirteenth Need for Speed game. It is considered one of the most hardcore installments of the series. Unlike many of its predecessors, it is oriented towards the actual driving simulation rather than arcade racing.GameplayThe creators of Shift aimed to realistically imitate the driving experience, making the game harder than an average NFS game. However, Shift automatically adjusts the difficulty depending on the player's experience and skills. Before the player enters the career, he or she has to complete a test drive at the famous Brands Hatch track to familiarize the game with his or her driving abilities. CarsNeed for Speed: Shift offers a roster of more than 60 vehicles. As in most Need for Speed games, the player starts with a small amount of money and only a handful of available vehicles. To unlock and purchase better cars, the player has to win races. The cars in Need for Speed: Shift consists of four classes called \"tiers\". The lowest tier contains the cheapest and slowest cars, while supercars from manufacturers like Lamborghini and Bugatti belong to the higher tiers. The game also has a detailed modification system. The player can customize not only the car's look but also its important details like tires and aerodynamics.TracksAs the player progresses, he or she may unlock new levels. Some of them are based on real-life tracks of Formula One fame, including Spa-Francorchamps, Nurburgring, Silverstone and Laguna Seca. Others are purely fictional and only exist in-game."

      "Three in a rowThe third part of the popular series of games in the genre three in a row, Bejeweled 3 was developed by the PopCap Games studio in 2010. The game was the fifth in the series, but the third one that received a number in the name. Originally released only on PC and Mac, but later it was ported to both consoles and mobile devices running Android, iOS, Java ME and Windows Phone. The developers called the game “the biggest Bejeweled experience available to date.” The game is available for free at partner sites.What to do?The goal of the game has not changed compared to the previous parts: the player must match three identical in color gem, which, if all is correct, they disappear. Rows of gems are constantly moving, and the game adds the random new gems on top screen. Thus, the player can launch a chain reaction and earn many points at once.What’s new?In the new part of Bejeweled, four new game modes appeared as well as new sound effects and improved graphics. However, this is true not for all versions of the game: so in the Java ME version, players have only four game modes available due to hardware limitations. There is Zen mode also in the game - a new one. There, players can customize the audio and visual components of the game and create their own meditative experience. There is no plot in the game, but you can earn 65 badges to prove the ultimate player’s skill."

      "Sleeping Dogs is a third-person action shooter with RPG elements, having Hong Kong as its central location. The city is an open world for the player’s exploration, and many gameplay features revolve around interacting with the surroundings. A huge aspect of immersion would be music, as it is themed according to the geographical location of the city.The main character Wei Shen finds himself in various situations which lead to the development of the main story. Resolving conflicts between local citizens and Hong Kong’s organized crime, the protagonist is offered to join one of the city’s gangs. Due to this, the players need to plan their actions carefully, building trust among both the gangsters and the police. The game features an unlock-based role-playing system, where every consecutive ability or trait is unlocked after the player achieves a specific goal or levels up character’s prestige in each of the three in-game groups. The combat system is heavily reliant on the character’s skill of martial arts, but conventional weaponry is also a favorable choice. Non-story related interactions add flavor to the overall gameplay, as there is a wide choice of how to spend the protagonist’s free time."

      "The game belongs to the genre of Arkanoid. It has all the classic features of games of this genre and several significant innovations and differences. The platform in this game has the ability to attract or repel all objects that are \"in the air\". This property is controlled by the player. In addition to the platform, other objects have similar properties, but they can not be controlled by the player.After several levels, the platform changes its horizontal position to a vertical one - and there are many similar changes in the game, it constantly surprises the player.Bosses, which the player meets at the end of each level, are carefully and ingeniously designed. They are able to successfully resist the player armed with the above ability to influence the \"magnetic field\" of the platform. To defeat each of them, the player will have to find some special tactics for each boss."

    "about": [
      "Dragon Age: Origins is the first game in BioWare’s RPG franchise Dragon Age. The game is considered to be the spiritual successor of BioWare’s classic fantasy RPG titles like Baldur’s Gate and Neverwinter Nights. Developers describe the game's setting as a mix of high fantasy and low fantasy. The storyline is centered around the event known as Blight, which occurs once in several hundred years and marks the demonic invasion in the world of Thedas.  The player creates its character by choosing its appearance, class, and race. There are 3 and three races in Dragon Age. The classes are the warrior, mage, rouge, and races are human, elf, and dwarf. The combination of class and race determines the character’s background story and the beginning of the game. The interaction between the player, his teammates and NPC’s is an integral part of the game. The game’s storyline often makes the player take moral decisions which affect his later interaction with characters and the game world in general."

    "about": [
      "Hitman 3: Contracts is an assassin simulator game developed by IO Interactive. It is a third installment in the Hitman series.Bleeding out Agent 47 tumbles into one of the rooms in an unknown Paris hotel. He passes out and starts hallucinating about his previous contracts. Each of these memories is a single mission that has to be completed by the player.In contrast to the previous game, the detection can be avoided much more easily. The enemies barely notice the Hitman dressed in someone else's clothing. They can still notice you if you stand in front of a guard for too long or openly carry a knife. Players have a lot of options for killing their target. Environmental kills are now much more common. For example, in one of the missions, the player has to eliminate a target using a pillow. The game now features a much more gritty tone. It usually takes place in foggy, rainy or snowy environments. There are many locations in a game ranging from a gothic manor to a meat processing plant where a BDSM party is held. 7 of the game's 12 levels are remakes of Hitman: Codename 47."

      "Resistance 2 is a sci-fi first-person shooter developed by Insomniac Games. It is the second part of the Resistance trilogy.PlotThe game takes place right after the ending of Resistance: Fall of Man. Nathan Hale wanders somewhere in a snowy forest after the destruction of an alien tower in London. Suddenly, a black ops squad finds him. They put their guns up on the protagonist and demand that Hale goes with them. At first, Nathan wants to blow himself and all the soldiers up with a grenade, but changes his mind and complies. His fight against the alien Chimeras continues.GameplayResistance 2 is mainly a singleplayer game. Many weapons from Fall of Man were reused, with several new additions such as the Marksman and a minigun. The game is based in the 1960s, so the weapons resemble a mix between the common weaponry of the time and advanced alien tech. Unlike the first game, the players can only carry two weapons at all times. Resistance 2 goes away from the health bar system in favor of regenerative health. That means that now the players have to stick to cover when their health is low to regenerate it.MultiplayerA multiplayer mode is also present in the game. However, there is no cooperative play in the singleplayer campaign. There are two multiplayer variations: a separate co-op campaign and a competitive one. The game was praised for having up to 60 players in one competitive session and up to 8 in a cooperative mode."

      "Instant classicThe stealth-action, which became a real classic and well-known among gamers. Excellent reviews and 92/100 score on Metacritic is a serious indicator. In the Steam community, there are still enthusiastic nostalgic reviews of almost everything that concerns Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. And there is an explanation for this. The game was released in 2005 and became the third in the Splinter Cell series. Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal was engaged in the development, who is also responsible for Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Critics and player noted the Xbox and PC versions of the game as the best. The storyIn Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the player will feel like a professional spy, NSA agent Sam Fisher from a special unit called “The Third Echelon.” The plot takes its origin from the first game in the series. However, the narrative is constructed in such a way that the player does not necessarily have to go through it in order to enjoy the story. The events of the game occur in different parts of the Earth that are based on places from the real world. At the heart of the game is the conflict unfolding between China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan.In addition to a single user campaign, there is the possibility of playing on the net. However, the official online services for this game were disabled as early as August 2016. Despite this, players still have the opportunity to play on the local network or, with due skill - through third-party services."

This time the player controls Lynch - a psychopath who now lives in Hong-Kong with his love Xiu. Kane, the protagonist of the first game, comes to Hong-Kong in hopes to get some money by smuggling guns to Africa together with Lynch, but at the very beginning of the game Lynch decides to do a little job with local mafia and Kane accidentally shoots a girlfriend of influential mafia person and everyone, starting with local hooligans, police and then military turns against the two. Kane & Lynch: Dog Days differs from all the other third person shooters by its original visual style and presentation. Everything what player sees is filtered by lo-fi visual effects and so everything looks like filmed with an old and cheap digital photo camera. The screen is shaking all the time, censuring wounds of shot enemies, colors of screen drastically changes when Lynch is wounded. The rhythm of the game is insanely quick to the point where it gets surreal."

The original Core-Team revamped their own creation, leveraging the best of today’s technology while remaining true to the classic side-scroller that set the standards of the genre in the 90’s.Key FeaturesOne of the best adventure-action games ever created re-imagined by its creators. It’s the same team. It’s the same passion. Only this time, they have had much more firepower at their disposal to recreate the legendary classic!Gorgeous graphics, amazing animations. It’s the Flashback you’ve always dreamed of. True to the original spirit but made a million times better by using modern engines such as Unreal and Havok. The makeover is completely stunning.It’s all about Gameplay. The team modernized gameplay mechanics, making the game more reactive, offering new features, like gadgets and an experience progression system. But the developers kept the original formula in mind: a fine balance between rolling and shooting, exploring remote space stations and obliterating hostile alien planets.Bringing back new memories. The story was revamped to speak to 21st century gamers. Most of the cast of the original game is still here – Conrad, the Morphs – but you can expect new characters and a few twists you’re definitely not going to forget… this time."

The game also introduces Tails – Sonic’s best friend and important character for the series. GameplayGameplaywise the game is very similar to its processor. The game consists of eleven zones.All zones, except the final one, are divided into two or three acts. In each act, your goal Is either to reach the finish of the level or to defeat a boss. The gameplay revolves around Sonic’s ability to run at high speed. The levels involve many objects that help Sonic gain high speed such as slopes, loops, and springs. Sonic can attack enemies and break certain obstacles by using Spin Attack. Like in previous game Spin Attack activates by gaining high speed while rolling on the ground or jumping but Sonic the Hedgehog 2 introduces new gameplay mechanic – Spin Dash. Pressing down and jump while stationary results in Sonic curling in a ball and then upon releasing the button launches launching forward at high speed. The game supports co-op multiplayer in which one player takes the role of Sonic and other plays as Tails."

These creatures sneak aboard the Leopold and begin to destroy the crew.Konrad fights to save his life and the ship.He is helped by the female android MIA, she gives advice, helps to find the right items.The action takes place both on the \"Leopold\" and on a hostile ship.Alien Breed 2: AssaultThe game begins where the history of the previous game ended. The hero of this game is the same Theodor J. Conrad, but his ship Leopold is already critically damaged and impossible to save.MIA is still trying to help Conrad, but becomes a victim of Klein - a man who managed to load his intellect into a computer that controls the alien ship. When trying to influence this computer, MIA fell under the influence of Klein's intellect and now cannot help Theodor.Klein tells Theodor that the ship was not really created by aliens, but by the inhabitants of Earth and is a huge scientific station, where earthlings explored alien beings.Alien Breed 3: DescentTheodor's situation becomes even more complex. Now the only one with whom Theodor can communicate is Klein's intellect, loaded into a computer. However, this is quite a developed \"creature\" that fully controls the ship, or rather, the scientific station, along with all the aliens on it. And this intelligence is able not only to control the aliens, but also to modify them.As it turned out, Klein is able to send against Theodor his last ally MIA - MIA did not die, but turned into a fully manipulated Klein artificial intelligence, opposed to Theodor. However, Theodor manages to win over her and she even tells him how to defeat Klein. This is not easy, because Klein directs against Theodor all the systems of a huge ship.GameplayThe gameplay has common features in all three games of the series.All games are shooters, the action of which takes place in the futuristic interiors of space ships.Each level contains several tasks, such as finding keys or restoring ship systems to work.Before leaving the level, the player must complete all tasks.Opponents are aliens.Interestingly, you can save the game only in special places. The same places serve as shops where upgrades and other useful things can be purchased.Information about opponents is revealed as the hero finds relevant sources of information in the game space."

The game puts the player into the role of an organizer of the arena fights. The player can purchase new gladiators and equip them with new weapons and armor. As the player wins more matches, his or her gladiators earn experience, and more equipment is unlocked. He or she can also purchase any items using the real-world money.CombatDuring battles, the player controls his or her gladiator while trying to defeat the opponent controlled either by the AI or by another player. The combat mechanics are simple and repetitive. They consist of kicks, punches, rolls, and blocks that can be used in a progression to form combo movements.

      "Doki-Doki Universe is an adventure video game with a heavy focus on personality measurement during the gameplay's process. This is the only games within the IP and the first one by HumaNature Studios.PlotThe developers tell a story of a QT3 — a robot who has been abandoned by humans due to lack of emotions which led him to fail “humanity test.” The main story arc is about QT3's ability to experience feelings. Alien Jeff comes to visit him after forty years of the isolations and checks whether he has gained any sentiments whatsoever.Gameplay featuresThe gaming process primarily consists of Jeff and QT3 visiting planets and evaluating moral choices on each one. Every planet looks unique and cartoon-like and is painted individually, without the procedural generation of the environment. The core feature of the game is the player's perception of himself, as he proceeds through the narrative structure of the game — depending on choices he made, including both randomly picking planet color and thoughtful decisions about the fates of the living creatures dwelling on a planet.To figure out the set of action on a particular planet, the player needs to figure out the likes and dislikes of the planet residents using summonables which are pictures every character may differently react to."

The game tells a story about the adventures of Sackboy, but there is no actual plot to follow in the game. The main focus is on the gameplay.The game bets on user-generated-content and invites everyone to add something of their own to it. Each new level is a new story, and the ability to create your own levels with the built-in editor greatly increases the time spent playing. You can go through the game alone or with your friends: on one console or using online services.In addition to the level editor, players can customize the Sackboy to their taste.

    "about": [
      "In this crime thriller, Kane and Lynch are hardened gangsters who are soon to be executed. Instead, they are released from the prison by a gang that believes Kane stole its money. The gang has Kane’s family as hostages and wants the money back. Kane, Lynch, and other criminals they will hire have to gather the required sum by robbing banks, kidnapping people for ransom, and completing other criminal tasks. Gameplay in Kane & Lynch is slightly reminiscent of GTA series with its third-person cop-shooting massacres. However, instead of the open world, there are consecutive levels with a mission in each, like in Hitman series (which was made by the same studio). In the story mode, Kane is the only protagonist under the player’s control. Lynch and other members of the gang are AI-controlled, though Kane can order them to move, follow, or attack. In the co-op mode, the other player can assume the role of Lynch. Playing for him is a little different because Lynch is a psychopath who sees hallucinations. There’s also an online multiplayer mode called Fragile Alliance that includes several new maps. In this mode, the team of players tries to survive the police assault and reach their getaway car."

      "PixelJunk Shooter is the fourth installment of the PixelJunk franchise, in which each game is based on another genre. Unlike the previous PixelJunk games, Shooter does not feature the series' trademark hardcore difficulty.PlotAnother departure from the PixelJunk traditions is that Shooter has a backstory. The game is set on a faraway planet Apoxus Prime. The scientists explore its enormous caves to mine resources. The player controls a starship called Ers Pinita Colada. Its captain answers to a distress signal from Apoxus Prime and tries to rescue the scientists lost in the caves.GameplayThe player flies the ship in the underground tunnels. The goal is to locate and save the scientists. The ship uses its gun to destroy enemies or to clear the way from ice and rocks. The ship has no hit points. Instead, a thermometer measures the ship's temperature. The player has to avoid overheating and remember to cool the ship, for example, by diving into water.The underground features monsters, villains and other dangers. There are many environmental puzzles that require the player to manipulate water, lava, stones, and other elements to access the scientists and unlock doors. PixelJunk Shooter has three episodes comprised of five levels each, and levels consist of short stages. The player can only progress by saving the scientists, and if five or more of them die, he or she has to restart. A secondary objective is to gather the collectibles such as diamonds."

Clear out the endless waves and groups and marauders with various weapon types and character abilities.Unlike the first game, Borderlands 2 provided DLC not only expanding the world of Pandora with stand-alone story campaigns but adding 2 more characters. Now the main cast consists of Gunzerker Salvador(dual-wields guns at command), Siren Maya (holds and paralyzes the enemy), Commando Axton (summons turrets) and Zer0 the Assasin (invisible sniper ninja). But with the DLC players can try out summoning giant flying robots with Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho. Most of the game charm and popularity of Borderlands 2 comes from the supporting cast and the personalities of the NPC, making this fast-paced shooter with optional cover stand out."

    "about": [
      "Vessel is a game about an engineer who operates machines in a heavily industrialized steampunk world. The player assumes the role of Arkwright, a genius scientist who invented a new type of automaton called Fluro. The Fluros are amorphous creatures that can be made of any type of liquid and perform tasks for people. One day, the Fluros mutated and went out of control, ruining most of the world’s machines. Arkwright has to find the cause of the malfunction and restore control over the Fluros. The gameplay consists of solving physics-based puzzles and manipulating the ridiculously complex machinery in a 2.5D environment. Arkwright jumps the platforms and pushes buttons to activate machines in a certain way. He can also use devices called Seeds to create new Fluros out of the liquids found on the levels, including lava. The Fluros, in turn, can be manipulated to perform helpful actions, such as to pull switches that are inaccessible for Arkwright. The liquid is the central element of the game, and a special graphics engine was made to animate it. The music by the famous DJ Jon Hopkins works as a hint for the player, becoming more complex when he or she does the right actions."

However, instead of protecting your base from waves of enemies, in this game, you try to break into aliens' facilities. The story is set in the near future when an alien spacecraft falls on Earth. As the head of an investigation team, you need to explore the anomalies happening around the parts of the ship and find out the information about the catastrophe. As the section of the spacecraft landed in several cities, game events take place around the world.  The core gameplay is reversed tower defense mechanics. You have several armor units in the convoy; however, you can't manage them directly. Instead, you need to set paths for them through the city streets and use different boosts to make your attack more effective and help the convoy survive. Anomaly: Warzone Earth is followed by Anomaly 2 that presents several new maps and mechanics including tower defense vs. tower offense multiplayer mode."

So now the squad of the elite soldiers has to discover, what was meant by the last message they received from the dense wall of raging sand.Spec Ops: The Line places the attention on the squad mechanics, where players can give orders to the NPCs, accompanying the player during the game. Aside from the single-player story campaign, players can join the multiplayer matches, which may vary from the solo/team deathmatch to “King of the Hill” type matches. Cooperative missions for two players have been added shortly after the game release. The single player campaign allows players to experiment with the weapons, carrying two at a time and use the environments to their advantage, using hazardous sandstorm to clear-out the enemies."

One of two main characters in the game Sam, a strange human-sized dog does not appear at the beginning of the game as players should wait for him a long time. Now Sam has to stop antagonists of both previous games and find those who took Max’s brain while he was in the bathroom. There are also strange flashbacks into the past, where we can see different versions of well-known characters. The gameplay as all the other entries in the series is divided in to small episodes where the player has to solve various different puzzles while controlling interesting and fun characters but this episode features a slightly new gameplay style with Sam searching alone for thieves in noir fashion using only dialogue options. He searches till he finds two villains from previous games General Skun-ka'pe and Monsieur Papierwaite in the museum. They are thieves Sam was searching for. Now, Sam has to defeat them and give back Max’s’ brain with the help of other new characters."

The game still uses the ancient Greek mythology as visual inspiration and the primary story source.The player takes control over the warrior Kratos. At the beginning of the game, the protagonist was imprisoned after he violated the blood oath given to the god of war Ares. One of the three goddesses of revenge Megera tortures Kratos, but he manages to break free and start the path to revenge on the gods of Olympus.Kratos still uses the dual Blade of Chaos. They can be improved, but this is not the only weapon in the game: other weapons are available for purchase thanks to the new World Weapons mechanics. The gameplay is no different from the other games of the series: the player still needs to connect the attacks in combos and arrange hack and slash mayhem. This is the only game in the series, in which multiplayer is available for eight people: the main task is to seize control of the card and get a reward from the gods."

      "In Darksiders, you play as War - one of the Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse. Two kingdoms, Heaven and Hell, could never solve their disagreements and battled each other from the beginning of time. \"The Charred Council\" arose in between two sides forming the brotherhood of Four Horsemen - War, Death, Strife and Fury. With these for horsemen on the watch and all the conflicts end, humanity has been born - a \"Kingdom of Man\". Council has created Seven Seals, that must be broken, when \"The Kingdom of Man\" will be ready for an Endwar. When our protagonist, War arrives on Earth, he sees that the final battle between Good and Evil already emerged without breaking Seven Seals. After fighting a demon called Straga, he is summoned by the council. It accuses him of destroying the balance, and that now the Apocalypse is unstoppable. Convincing the council in his innocence, War now has to stop the Endwar.Darksiders is a typical hack-and-slash game that lets you produce comboes with two primary weapons - Chaoseater and Scythe - and various gadgets. While defeating his enemies, War can execute them with brutality. The gameplay is undertoned with dark mythology bound with the present days."

      "This game is both a puzzle and a platformer. The plot and the gameplay are based on the game with light.The player plays like a little man, who is in almost total darkness. A spot of light snatches from the darkness a small part, in which the little man can move. The space for movement is limited by a spot of light, but sometimes outside of this spot or on the border of light and darkness it is possible to move quite freely - for example, even to pass through walls or fall through floors / ceilings. Sometimes it is not enough to be in a spot of light or in darkness for movement. The path is sometimes blocked by various obstacles, or this path simply needs to be found, it is necessary to understand how and where you can move - the goal of the game is to find the final exit.Among the puzzles are the search for various keys and ways to apply these keys, finding and moving light sources and other things. The game assumes that sooner or later the player will master the relationship with the light and will be able to use this understanding to achieve the ultimate goal."

It is an action RPG with wide customization opportunities and several endings that depend on your choices during the game. There are side quests you can complete, and a relationship system that opens new ways to fulfill tasks and lets to romance some characters. The game follows traditions of the cosmic opera genre and features interstellar travel, space fights, and interaction with various alien races. Mass Effect 3 heavily focuses on combat; the core is shooting with a cover system and pursuits.You play as Commander Shepard (who can rather be male or female) during his fight against the race of Reapers, that invades Earth. The only hope of the world is the absolute weapon you have to create with the help of all races. The tone of the series switched to more pessimistic compared to previous games. Your actions may lead to the deaths of your friends, and this makes your choices harder. The game is followed by Mass Effect: Andromeda, however, this installment is not a direct sequel to the trilogy and follows the story of brand new characters."

      "DeathSpank: Orphans of Justice is a parody of fantasy RPGs, the first in DeathSpank trilogy. It features a comically cartoonish visual style and deconstructs the genre's cliches and stereotypes. The game's main designer is Ron Gilbert, best known as the creator of The Secret of Monkey Island and other LucasArts adventure games.PlotThe titular DeathSpank is the game's main protagonist. He is a larger-than-life masked champion of goodness on a quest to save the world. His goal is to find The Artifact, an object so mysterious that nothing is known about it: neither its shape nor its purpose. Nevertheless, DeathSpank and his companion, the bearded and robed wizard named Sparkles, believe this McGuffin to be critical. And so does their antagonist, the evil Lord Von Prong, who also searches for The Artifact. DeathSpank is one step from finding the elusive Artifact, but it slips away at the last moment. To complete his quest, DeathSpank needs assistance from local people, who, in return, send him on multiple side quests.GameplayAccording to Ron Gilbert, DeathSpank is a cross between Monkey Island and Diablo series. The game combines elements from action-RPGs and visual adventures. The combat system is essentially the same as in Diablo. The protagonist can obtain and use various types of weapons and armor and perform comb movements. There's also the Justice Meter that grows when DeathSpank defeats the villains. When it reaches the maximum, it buffs DeathSpank with a temporary power-up."

That is the only game within the IP.GameplayThe game consists of the player and infinite waves of the enemies divided into the levels. The walkthrough may be eased by inviting up to three other players into the game. There are seven game mods: \"Quest\", featuring 60 levels on different areas, each with the individual set of goal thus the name; \"Survival\" in which there are infinite waves of enemies and player is challenged to hold out as long as possible; \"Rush\" gives the protagonist only AK-47 and asks him to react quickly to the enemies; \"Nukefism\" does not allow the player to wield any weapon, but the collection of bonuses allows him to crash the foes; \"Weapon Picker\" speaks for itself — there is no ability reload, so the player is forced to change the firearm every time they run out of ammo. \"Blitz\" is just upgraded \"Survival\" and finally the \"Gembine\" which is just 2048 tiles game in the Crimsonland setting. The \"Typ'o'Shooter\" mode was removed — players had to type the words appearing on the screen to kill the enemies in it.StoryThe title features no storyline whatsoever. The only sign of a story is the quest system. Completing the quest allows the player to unlock more weapons and perks."

      "Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a stealth-action platformer game developed by Sanzaru games. It is the fourth installment in the series and serves as a direct sequel to Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves.PlotSly Cooper's friend Bentley notices that the pages of the Sly family clan manuscript turn blank. That means that someone is changing the history of the clan. Sly and his friends use a time machine that brings them back to feudal Japan in order to fix the timeline.GameplayLike the previous installments of the series, the game is a platformer with several stealth-action elements. The players control a set of characters, each of which has their own abilities and tasks to complete. It is possible to switch between the characters during the gameplay as the players see fit. Unlike the previous games, where Sly Cooper only unlocked new skills, in Thieves in Time, Sly is awarded new suits, that offer their own range of abilities. For example, using the archer suit allows Sly to shoot an arrow with a rope tied to it from his bow to get to hidden areas of the game.There is a number of hidden treasures and masks in the game. Each treasure found is later added to the in-game collection and has its own description. Bottles with clues in them make a comeback in Thieves in Time. Upon finding them, the player can unlock a treasure safe which contains several bonuses within itself."

The realm prospered for a long time, until the ruler of the Ashen Kingdom struck a deal with demons, and invaded his neighbors. The player must take action as one of the six playable characters, each with different classes and abilities, and save the world.GameplayThe third game of the series has shifted from being an RPG diablo-like game to an arcade slasher, removing skill trees and development, while adding even more enemies, dynamic action and refined physics. Each level in the campaign shares similarities with one another, as the objectives are simple: defeat enemies, reach the checkpoint, defeat the boss and unlock the next level.Graphics and other featuresThe game is rich with fantasy characters, colorful landscapes and well-designed enemies. The special effects in battle provide the player with an arcade touch: blood splatters from every foe, mysterious explosions occur to left and right, ground quakes from fearsome bosses.  The game features a 4-player cooperative mode, where players take up arms as different heroes and join in battles against hordes of enemies."

The action switches between three playable characters and covers the Pacific Theater and Eastern Front. The story begins with U.S. Marine Private C. Miller who is captured by the Japanese and waits for execution. Later it jumps over war theaters and the timeline, skipping entire months.The battles in World at War are quite realistic, with the maximum of two weapons you can carry plus hand grenades. AI allies fight alongside to you, and there's also a cover system that helps to restore health and complete stealthy missions. The variety of levels includes PBY missions, sniper tasks, and sea battles. World at War is the first game of the franchise to introduce Nazi Zombies mode - a cooperative mini-game where 2 to 4 players fight endless hordes of zombies. While the area cover in this mode is quite small, it was expanded by the World at War map packs."

      "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure and a straight continuation of the first part of the franchise. It is also 39th part of the vast Castlevania series. The game currently features no successors.GameplayThe game, unlike its predecessor, features an open-world structure. The player follows the adventures of Gabriel Belmont through medieval settings and modern environments. Sometimes — at the start of the story, to be precise — the players gain control of Dracula who possesses Gabriel and gives him similar powers. The game consists of many fighting sequences in which combos are of importance — the various swords and claws, some allowing the protagonist to replenish his health and the other dealing massive damage to the enemies.StoryThe game is highly story-driven. At the start, the developers present the players with the scenes of flashbacks, in which the transformation to Dracula is shown. While set in medieval settings, events depict Dracula as he quickly gets ambushed by his resurrected son and thrown back into the modern times where he starts his adventures.DLCThe Revelations DLC released a month after the initial game announcement brings some story arc to the game, while the others: \"Dark Dracula\" and \"Armored Dracula\" bring only new characters skins and sprites."

The title is developed by Honeyslug and is the only game within the corresponding IP.Gameplay and featuresOne must navigate an unknown creature called Long Mover who looks very much like a worm through the 2D platforming sections composed of different-colored minimalistic objects and NPCs. 17 locations called worlds have no connection whatsoever and may be explored in any way one desires. The player may affect only the speed of Long Mover — slow him down or speed him up. However, the game build interaction with an NPCs through the back-riding mechanics — all of the information about goals or secondary tasks is known from the locals who ride the player's back.The purpose of almost every level is to wake the creature within its bounds by tickling its eyes.Key featuresIt is both feature and philosophy of the game — highlighting no narrative or instructions the game lets the player move into and flow within its worlds. The absence of story, nonetheless, compensates with goals — each world has one primary and multiple secondary tasks. Meeting the requirements in all areas brings the player to “the end” — the credits meaning an apparent end of the gameplay. Namely, the play may be continued afterward."

      "Oblivion is the fourth part of the acclaimed The Elder Scrolls series. It is set in the high fantasy world of Tamriel, in the Septim Empire. The emperor was recently killed along with his sons, except one that was hidden far from the capital. Before he died, the emperor gave his Amulet of Kings to the protagonist, a prisoner whom the emperor believed to be a future hero he saw in dreams. The main character is fully customizable. His or her character class race, gender, age and other attributes are chosen by the player. His quest is to escape prison and find the royal heir. However, since the game is open-world, the player may abandon the central storyline and just wander around Tamriel. You can complete a variety of side quests, join various guilds and factions, or just fight monsters to gain experience. There's an option of \"fast travel\" that allows you to instantly move to an already discovered location.Game of the Year Edition also contains two expansion packs: Shivering Isles and the Knights of the Nine that expand the game’s storyline. The packs introduce several new locations, two additional factions (the Court of Madness and Knights of the Nine), and a number of new armor, weapons and other items."

    "about": [
      "Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is an action adventure game and a part of the vast Prince of Persia series which includes ten titles overall. Sands of Time precede it and followed by The Two ThronesGameplayAll the big titles in the series feature pretty much the same mechanics: 3D platforming with a heavy focus on the fighting elements and parkour. The game is the first in the group to have a non-linear structure with the protagonist returning to the previously visited areas and opening hidden paths with the new tools acquired along the way. The fighting system presents wielding two weapons at a time with the latter being divided into two main categories: melee — primary weapons and throwable — secondary ones. GameplayThe events depicted in the game take place seven years after the previous game in the series — The Sands of Time. The narrative centers around the antagonism of the protagonist of The Prince and Dahaka — the mystical beast, hunting him because he released the Sands of Time in the previous installment. The game features two endings: a canonical \"good\" one the storyline of which is transferred in the next chapter of The Prince's journey and the \"bad\" one. The difference lies in the Water Sword achievable through gathering all the collectibles for upgrading the life meter."

Then this witch kidnapped his girlfriend. While sulking in the river, the frog prince found a bottle of Lucozade. This drink gave him extraordinary powers. After that, the frog decided to fight the witch and save his beloved. GameplayIn addition to the main aim of the game, which is to rescue a princess, there are some other objectives (to find a golden key, for instance). The player has to complete 24 levels.These levels are divided into six environments. On every level, you are tasked to get enough coins to have a possibility to exit. You can restore a timer countdown and your health by getting a bottle of Lucozade. The credits award the player at the end of each level. The number of credits depends on the number of coins and fruit, you collected, and on time, you spend on finishing every level. There are two ways to use these credits. You can keep them or gamble in a mini-game to receive bonuses. You have a chance to get a level code, allowing you to start over the game from the next level’s beginning later. In the end, the player should win in a boss fight with the witch. This fight takes place in the castle."

The transformation of matter in the game is quite elaborated: lava can cool down to the state of stone, plants grow only on fertile soil, various weather conditions and cataclysms are simulated. The player controls a spherical cursor that is able to change matter and thereby help the natives. Structurally, the game consists of several missions that are linked together by a single story about a tribe of islanders and their quest for finding lost knowledge. The game has two modes: Story and Challenge mode."

      "Welcome to Steelport, a city that’s been torn by the three violent gangs. And seemingly, only another violent gang can stop them. After merging with Ultor Corporation after the events of the second game, Boss and his lieutenants became a corporation of their own. And now, after a run-in with the corrupt police forces, when they’re in the hands of the Syndicate, alone and cut out from the gathered wealth and support, 3rd Street Saints have to start from the bottom. While being a third person action adventure game, Saints Row: the Third is described by developers as the game that has everything in it. While the base game is reminiscent of GTA type of games mechanically, shifting tone and frantic story create the comedic and exciting atmosphere. A long line of DLC adding to the game not only unique missions, even by the Saints Row standards, but customization items, transport, and outfits. Reviews adore the lack of serious tone and gritty realism."

The ability to open tears to another dimension is like this a particular kind of representing escapism. The game features platforming sections, and the ability to turn the real world into the magical one is introduced: tools brought out from the latter may aid the protagonist in their quest. The whole magical setting is very much like going into another dimension for the stuff needed. The Monster is also a crucial part of the gameplay — he helps Quico to hop around the gaps.

      "Ultratron is a 2D top-down twin-stick shooter set in the fictional universe and inspired by Robotron: 2084 — an arcade video game about robots.GameplayThe player controls a robot and explores the locations as he pleases — there is no forcing to go further or backward. Traditionally, the left stick accounts for aiming and the right sticks sets the direction of fire. Not only the robot can utilize the firearms, but the explosives alongside with other throwables are available. The customization takes place between the levels — upgrades may be found on the battlefield and present themselves as score points which may develop one of the robot's characteristics: shields, smart bombs, droid power or so.There are forty levels in total, with every fifth being the assault one — the foes are more aggressive and unwelcoming there, and every tenth is a boss level. The goal of every level is to eliminate all the enemies and get to the end of the location. The title sometimes features the bullet hell elements — there are so many enemies on-screen, they start forming a distinct pattern recognizable as a picture.PlotThe setting is near post-apocalyptic future, where the brains were taken out of the humans and implanted into the war robots, who fight their way to the humans left to defend them from their dreadful fate."

In Alone In The Dark, the players are free to choose from both first-person and third-person camera at any point during gameplay. The environment of the game plays a big part in the gameplay as the player can pick up any object and use it as a melee weapon. Such objects can also be used to break doors or get unreachable items.The game also features a realistic fire model, so some items can be lit up in the fire. A crafting system is also present in the game. For example, the medical spray can be used to treat wounds, but if combined with a lighter, it becomes a flamethrower."

In the course of the completion, players will be able to get some additional information about the protagonist’s relationship with the princess. Players control the protagonist as he climbs platforms, jumps on the enemies to defeat them and to collect keys to hidden quests and mosaic parts. Players have to lead Tim through 6 worlds, each based on an intriguing time mechanic, as Tim features the ability to rewind the original pace of time. For example, Time and Forgiveness world allows respawning Tim after his death by switching time back. To attend the last level, Tim must assemble the mosaic. The story ends in the world simply called “1”, where time flows in reverse and returns to the normal pace by rewinding. The last room of the final world contains Tim’s meeting with the princess, but, due to the time pace turned back, players face some unpredictable twists of the plot."

      "FIFA 12 is the nineteenth installment of the decades-spanning series of soccer simulators by Electronic Arts. It is based on the 2012 season.Changes from the previous gamesWhile FIFA 12 did not change the gameplay dramatically, the game includes several important updates. The most notable is Impact Engine that calculates procedurally generated collisions based on laws of physics. The engine takes into account the players' stats as well as the speed and angle of the collision. This makes the game less predictable and more realistic. The engine also influences the injuries of the players. The game also introduces a new Tactical Defending system that gives the player more control over his or her defenses, and the Precision Dribbling option that allows the player to protect the ball while dribbling it. Another new feature is Pro Player Intelligence that makes the AI-controlled players take into account their teammates' skills.TeamsThe game includes 29 national leagues and 42 national teams. Notably, however, both the Czech national team and league are absent, as well as several others that were present in FIFA 11. MultiplayerThe game introduced Head to Head Seasons mode that offers the players to progress through the ten divisions during ten seasons of ten games each. A new system automatically pairs the players with similar preferences, such as manual control, against each other."

    "about": [
      "Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack is a side-scrolling platformer developed by DrinkBox Studios. The game serves as a prequel to another game by the studio, Tales From Space: About a Blob.PlotThe game tells the story of the blob who is named Blob. Blob escapes from his own homeworld and ends up on Earth, where he begins consuming everything he finds while exploring the planet.GameplayThe players control Blob. At the beginning of the level, Blob is tiny, but when he eats something, he gets a bit bigger. This allows the players to grom Blob to enormous sizes by eating the loosely-placed items in the in-game world. The main objective of the player is to pass a specific obstacle located at every level of the game to complete it. The players can use Blob's multiple mutant abilities. For example, he can transform into a rocket for a limited amount of time, stick to walls or even use telekinesis to manipulate the in-game items. The game heavily relies on its advanced physics simulation system. The levels are highly interactive, so the question of how to approach a specific level is completely up to the player.StyleThe 1950s heavily inspire the game's art style. Architecture, music, and even this era-specific humor can be found in the game. The game features a distinct animation style which can also be found in the old Batman or Spider-man TV shows."

      "Zeno Clash II is a fantasy action game that combines multiple genres. Like its predecessor, Zeno Clash (2009), it uses the first-person view.PlotThe setting of Zeno Clash II is a weird fantasy world called Zenozoik. The main protagonist of the original game, Ghat, makes a return. His companion Deadra, however, is replaced by Ghat's sister Rimat, who was one of his opponents in the previous game. The two siblings put their differences aside to team up against a new villain: a golem called Kax-Teh. Years ago, Ghat brought this creature with him to Zenozoik, and now the golem became too powerful for Ghat to tolerate.GameplayThe game features an unusual combination of role-playing, fighting and beat 'em up elements. The player controls Ghat, accompanied by AI-controlled Rimat, and leads him through a series of battles. The gameplay mostly consists of hand-to-hand fights, though the player can occasionally use weapons. Zeno Clash II has a unique combat system in which the amount of damage depends on which body part was hit. All battle movements cost stamina that has to be replenished. The RPG element allows the characters to improve their skills and abilities as they progress through the game. They can also find and equip new items. ModesZeno Clash II introduced a new cooperative multiplayer mode, in which the second player assumes the role of Rimat. There are also the Arena modes, which allow the players to fight each other or a series of AI-controlled opponents."

The plot is set in an alternate history timeline, in which there's an ongoing war between the United States and Russia; and the Russians are winning. They have already conquered most of Eurasia and made Latin American Countries their allies. The protagonist is a member of Bravo-2 spec ops squad. He is tasked with eliminating colonel Arkady Kirilenko, the leader of a secret project that is about to produce a Russian superweapon that can be used to defeat the US once and for all. The rest of Bravo-2 is computer-controlled. The NPC will assist the player and are technically immortal; however, they cannot complete missions without player's actions.While most of the time you play as infantry, there are certain stages where players can drive tanks, helicopters, gun turrets and other vehicles. One of the most distinctive features of the game's Frostbite engine is that all elements of the environment are fully destructible. Besides plot-driven single-player campaign, there's also multiplayer that allows five different modes. All characters are divided into four classes: Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon. Medics, in particular, can speed up the health regeneration; however, lost hit points are slowly restored by themselves."

The emperor had perished, and the main characters face danger again: the enemies regrouped and are preparing to strike back. The the main character squad is forced to fight through the enemy lines only to get to the evacuation point. One of the narrative features is that the story also unfolds from the main antagonists’ point of view.The gameplay is still cinematic and has not changed much compared to the last part. Jetpacks were added to the game, and the hand-to-hand combat system was reworked, adding new brutal melee attacks and combo attacks.

The pirates noticed that they have heard this story a thousand times already and asked Guybrush to tell something new. The hero shares that the events of the new chapter of his adventures are unfolding right now: he is looking for the legendary pirate treasure of Big Whoop.Key featuresThe game is a classic point-and-click adventure.

The game focuses heavily on combat and features a scoring system named Skillshot. Players gain points for every kill, the more creative the murder is - the more points one gets. Environmental kills are valued the most. Points are used as currency that can be used to upgrade your weapons, buy new ones or get ammunition.Players can carry three weapons with the assault rifle being the default one and can always be found in one's inventory.There is no competitive multiplayer in Bulletstorm, but co-op and score attack modes are available.On release, the developers made fun of other games in the marketing campaign. The dark humor was one of the defining aspects of Bulletstorm."

      "The Sims 3 is the third part of its series. Like all Sims game, it allows the player to control the life of a person or even a whole family.Character creationBefore the main game starts, the player has to create his or her character, called sim. The player can choose to play as a single character or a family. The game allows full customization for each sim. The player chooses their gender, age, race, and body type, as well as their traits that influence the sim's in-game behavior. The traits help sims to learn new skills that will be useful in their job and social life. The player can also choose to set all settings to random. There are also settings that define if the sims will age, and how fast.GameplayThe game introduces the open world that lives on its own even when the player doesn't interfere. Unlike in Sims 2, the world is seamless and there's no long load time when you travel it. The sims themselves became more independent and require less player attention to stay alive. Sims 3 is less oriented towards \"tamagotchi\"-like life-sustaining and more towards actually living the sims' lives, such as going to work, attending parties, making friends and flirting. The sims will occasionally have wishes, and fulfilling them earns the character more happiness points.Building homesThe building mode didn't change much since Sims 2, but the game introduced a few additional options. Most notably, elements don't have to be aligned to a grid anymore. The player can place them diagonally at any angle."

However, the car may be destroyed in Highway Battle — one of the game mods. The title features some RPG elements — wheelman points, which grants the player access to bonus levels and car parts. The police in the game are traced by the bar at the top of the screen varying between Busted and Evade modes. The capturing of the player results in the checkpoint restart.PlotThe game's title suggests the protagonist role in the story — he is an undercover police agent given a task to infiltrate the group of street-racers to expose them to arrest.

The series is inspired by the classic Bioware RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights, and some of the game’s writers have previously worked on these titles.PlotDragon Age II is set in the medieval world of Thedas, inhabited by mythological races like elves and dwarves. This high fantasy setting has a definitive \"Dark Ages\" atmosphere. The game continues the plot of Dragon Age: Origins, and the player can choose which ending of the original game to use as a backstory. The player assumes the role of a protagonist named Hawke. He or she is a human who had to flee from an invasion of the monsters called Darkspawns. Over the course of the game, Hawke eventually rises to power and influences the fate of the whole Thedas.GameplayThe main protagonist is fully customizable. The player can choose his or her first name, gender, appearance and character class. There are three classes available: mage, warrior, and rogue. The player controls not only Hawke but also his or her party that can include up to three companions at once. You can only control one character at a time, however, switching between them while leaving the rest to AI control. Dragon Age II introduced the dialogue wheel that was borrowed from the Mass Effect series. Dialogue options usually have a tone that defines how other characters perceive each line and, eventually, the protagonist's personality."

    "about": [
      "Sine Mora is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up game developed by Digital Reality.Set on the distant planet, that is ruled by the Layil Empire, the race of Enkie is being enslaved and exterminated. The story revolves around two resistance groups that fight for different goals and in different parts of the planet. They eventually get together and cooperate. Enkies are able to time travel, so the story is set in different timelines both in the past and the future. Every level of the game has to be completed before the time limit expires. Players gain more time by destroying enemy targets and lose time for getting hit. There are multiple weapons in the game such as seeker missiles and energy beams. The players can slow down time. Powerups are also scattered around the levels which increase the rate of fire or replenish ammo. There are 18 bosses featured in Sine Mora. The players have to figure out the weak spots and the tactics of their enemy in order to pass the level."

      "Valkyria Chronicles takes place during the early period of World War II in a fictional region which is in Europa. The peaceful nation of Gallia is attacked by East European Imperial Alliance because of Ragnite ore which is a petrol in the game's universe and which Gallia nation has a lot. The main focus of Valkyria Chronicles plot is the resistance against Imperial Army. One of the game's selling point is the visual style which is similar to cell-shading and looks like it all was drawn with a pencil. This is one of those \"playable anime\" kind-of games. The gameplay itself is fun yet difficult if a player doesn't know what to do. It is turn-based and every turn should be well-measured. There are phases of player characters and of enemies. Wins that which is planning his turns more thoughtful. The game also has a strong anti-war message."

      "Anna is a creepy horror game in which the protagonist researches the mystery of a haunted house. Its dark atmosphere is reminiscent of Silent Hill games. However, Anna has an emphasis on puzzle solving and no battles.PlotThe game is set in the Northern Italy, in the mountainous region of the Alps. The setting was modeled after a real place, and the story is inspired by the Alpine folklore. The player controls a man who lost his memory. He only can vaguely remember a sawmill and a woman called Anna. The protagonist visits the sawmill that is apparently haunted. He has to discover the uneasy secrets of his past and the fate of Anna.GameplayThe player's goal is to solve the puzzles to move forward and uncover the mystery of Anna by recalling dialogues the protagonist had with her. Unlike in most adventure games, not all items the protagonist can carry are useful. The game does not highlight the important items.Extended EditionThe Extended Edition is a dramatically improved version of Anna. It was based on the feedback and criticism the original game received. This edition introduces a new AI-controlled character called \"The Wife Doll.\" It also adds letters, books and other documents that provide insight into the mystery. Unlike in the original version, which had no \"game over\" option, the player can lose sanity after encountering supernatural phenomena. It leads to a \"bad\" ending. This edition also has improved graphics and user interface, as well as additional locations."

      "Planets Under Attack is a space-themed strategy game.  GameplayThe main single-player mode in the game is a campaign that consists of many missions. The goal of most missions is to capture and develop certain planets on the game map.To do so, you control your spacecraft fleet. Captured planets are not only strategically essential points and means to complete the mission, but they also produce Sollars — the primary currency in the game. You need Sollars for most of the actions that you can do in the game including upgrading your spaceships, planets, or even moving and dispatching your units. While conquering neutral planets is usually no hard task, you continuously encounter opposing forces (AI in single-player or other players in multiplayer) that also try to take over the planets and destroy your forces. The battles occur automatically, so the game’s primary challenge is in proper management and your fleet arrangement. There are several races available in the game, each of which has unique properties. After the end of each match, the fraction you chose would gain points that can be exchanged for ‘techs’ which give you passive upgrades such fleet strength or decreased time to upgrade planets. There are also three difficulty settings, ranging from easy to hard."

    "about": [
      "Sonic The Hedgehog is a 2D platform game, the first installment in Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog series. PlotThe game takes place on South Island and follows Sonic — an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog. The game’s antagonist, a brilliant but insane scientist Dr. Robotnik attempts to take possession of the power of six Chaos Emeralds by entrapping South Island’s animal inhabitants inside hostile robots. Sonic decides to hinder Robotnik’s plans by freeing animals and collecting the emeralds himself.  GameplayThe game consists of six zones each of which is divided into three acts. In the first two acts, your goal is to reach the finish while the third act ends with a boss fight against Dr. Robotnik. After completing the sixth zone, you enter the Final Zone which consists of one act and the final battle against Robotnik. The level in the game is usually relatively roomy and implicate various ways of completing. The gameplay is centered on Sonic’s ability to run at high speed. Thereby the levels involve many slopes, loops, springs. Sonic can use Spin Attack to attack enemies or destroy certain obstacles.The Spin Attack can be activated by gaining high speed while rolling on the ground or jumping. The players’ health depends on the main collectibles of the game – golden rings placed throughout the levels and collecting one hundred of them gives you an extra life. Also, as long as Sonic has at least one ring, upon getting hit he scatters rings instead of losing a life."

    "about": [
      "OlliOlli is a skating simulator, is an indie-game developed initially for handhelds, e.g., PS Vita. It is the first title of the series with the second numerical part of the series a year afterward.GameplayThe player is presented with the 2D world, which is filled with the ramps, cliffs, railings, and another environment to perform tricks on. As in many titles of its sort, the player gets bonuses for the number of stunts, safety landing and doing combos. The world consists of 50 levels: each one has 5 (250 overall) trophies, accomplishing every one of them unlocks the next level and so on. StylisticsThe game features pixel-art graphics presuming the level design to be minimalistic. Such style, nevertheless, brings a unique trait to the game's mechanics. While it doesn't feature any of the usual skateboarding title's trampolines and pools, the minimalistic nature of the Olliolli brings the hardcore out and forces the one behind the controller to mash the buttons repeatedly, memorizing the playthrough during the entire level. Final parts of the game resemble the hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy more than they resemble traditional skating games like Tony Hawk.The title is also being praised for the soundtrack — it matches the indie stylistics and is available for sale separately."

    "about": [
      "Catherine is a platformer/visual novel developed by Atlus for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011.PlotThe plot follows the adventures of Vincent Brooks, who is choosing between the two girlfriends — Katerine and Catherine with the opposite personalities. While making relationship choices throughout the daytime, Vinet is forced to participate in realistic nightmares at night. The setting of a title is two narratives folded one into another: on the outer layer, the game has TV-Show \"The Midnight Versus\" which tells the story of an inner layer — the adventures of \"Catherine\" world.GameplayThe gaming process consists of two stages, according to the protagonist's activities. While the ventures during the day resemble the usual visual novel mechanics: walking, listening to dialogues and watching cinematics pieces, the action gameplay reveals itself in the night. There Vincent has to climb a set of stairs by removing and climbing blocks to avoid traps. If he fails — the protagonist dies in real life.ReceptionThe game journalists generally liked the game but were disappointed by the sexists and misogynistic stories found within it. The title obtained commercial success, and thus there is a remaster coming out for PS4 and Vita. The remaster was half-ready in late 2017."

      "Syberia is an adventure game where a twisted story is combined with puzzle solving and a graphical quest’s elements. You take on the role of Kate Walker, who has to travel over half of Europe to fix her business issues. However, her adventure appears to be exciting and surreal, and, actually, life-changing. Searching for a man to sell her a toy factory, Kate becomes involved in a fantastic journey that leads her to the land of Syberia where mammoths are still alive.The main gameplay activity is classical for point-and-click quests and for the most part is solving numerous complicated puzzles that are tightly connected with the plot development and extend and deepen the story. Huge locations may contain dozens of puzzles, so finding all clues will make you explore every corner of every place. Puzzles often feature work with details from mechanisms and odd inventions. The gameplay supports the surreal atmosphere of the game which twists the reality with human dreams and hopes.Syberia is followed by two sequels, Syberia II and Syberia 3, that continue the adventures of Kate Walker."

      "Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed by Valve Corporation and released on April 19, 2011 on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. Its plot directly follows the first game's, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...Portal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.Portal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor."

Unlike previous installments, utilizing such mechanics, in Split/Second the player must fill the \"power play\" bar and unleash its power on the nearby construction — for example, crush the water boiler when there are opponents underneath it. The strength of the effect depends on how full the power bar is — there are two levels of damage available. The first-level collisions are mostly minor and lie in the field of damaging some constructions and crushing the billboards, while the second-level ones activate during the full bar completion are lead to the structural damage of the map facilities frequently leading to route changes and landscape altering.PlotPower Play mechanics is powered by the narrative underlining it as it tells the story of a TV Show, the participators of which are all the racers including our protagonist. The meter, in this case, represents the reviews watchers give to the show members. The computer-controlled opponents can also turn on the ability and crush something on the player's vehicle — so the audience votes not only for the protagonist."

    "about": [
      "Shank, the first game in the series of its name, is defined by its comic-book visual style and graphic violence in the vein of Tarantino and Rodriguez movies. In the single-player mode, the game follows a story of a revenge. The player assumes the control of Shank, who used to be a mafia hitman before they killed his only love, Eva. He goes on a vendetta after her murderers, hunting them down and killing in brutal ways. There's also a cooperative mode that features a different plot, something of a prequel to the main storyline. In co-op, Shank and the other playable character, Falcone, have to save a strip model from a gang of bikers and fix a rigged wrestling match.The game is played as a fast-paced 2D side-scroller. Shank uses three types of weapons: a firearm, a melee weapon, such as a chainsaw, and two daggers. All three should be used interchangeably to create a variety of combo movements, which are essential to master before you reach the late stages of the game. Enemy attacks can be dodged or blocked. Shank can also perform a number of acrobatic tricks and other movements, such as throwing enemies or jumping on them, which makes for a varied gameplay."

      "Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a Japanese role-playing game, a direct sequel to 2009 title Final Fantasy XIII and the third installment in Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. PlotThe game takes place three years after the event of the original game. Final Fantasy XIII’s main character Lightning, appears only as a supporting character, while the story follows her sister, Serah Farron, and a new character Noel Kreiss. GameplayThe gameplay is almost identical to that of the original game. The battle system is presented as Command Synergy Battle. It is based on usage of Action Time Battle bar: the bar consists of several slots that are used to perform attacks or cast spells and gradually refills during the battle. However, the game has some significant differences compared to the original game. The areas are more opened and endorse exploration. The party consists only of two characters, while the third spot is reserved for tamed monsters. The game also uses a random encounter system from previous installments.PlotThe storyline follows the events of the XIII. They, however, do not connect to the other Final Fantasies so any chapter of the series may be played in unspecified order. The protagonists of the game are six youngsters who are trying to prevent the end of the world."

      "The first game in The Force Unleashed project is set in the Star Wars universe after the ending of The Revenge of the Sith and describes the early years of the Galactic Empire. The game is one of the few that allow the player to assume the role of a Sith disciple, although you will eventually have to choose between the light and dark side of the Force. The protagonist is Starkiller (a reference to the early draft version of Skywalker), the secret padawan of Darth Vader himself. The young apprentice is tasked with hunting down and killing the few remaining Jedi Knights. He will travel to various planets of the galaxy far, far away and fight Jedi and rebels using his lightsaber and special Force abilities, such as telekinesis and force choking. Both types of attacks can be used to form combo movements. Defeating enemies earns Starkiller experience points that can be used to level up his skills.Ultimate Sith Edition includes three additional levels: two DLC missions set on Tatooine and Coruscant and a previously unreleased level set on Hoth. The Tatooine mission starts the Infinities plotline, which follows the non-canon “dark” ending of the original game. The Hoth mission concludes it and sets you up against the famous Luke Skywalker."

      "Need for Speed: Most Wanted - A Criterion Game is an open world racing game and it is the nineteenth entry in the famous racing series. This is a reboot of the game with the same title released in 2005. In the game players have to select a car and compete against other racers in various events like Sprint races, Circuit, races and Speed runs. There is also an Ambush races mode, where players have to escape from the police as fast as possible. Like in the original Need for Speed: Most Wanted game, cops can start to pursue the player during the race and as well as in the original players have to compete against other racers and if succeeded they instantly get their cars. The game takes place in a regular city called Fairhaven, which has a beach and an industrial district as well as the main highway. The game was praised for those who are fans of Burnout series, especially because of its way of races where there is a start and finish of the race but players have an option to choose which way they want to go."

      "STREET FIGHTER IV is a fighting game, the fourth main installment in Capcom’s Street Fighter series.  PlotStorywise the game is a sequel to Street Fighter II and prequel to Street Fighter III. The S.I.N corporation begins a new tournament for the best fighters from all over the world. Although each participant has its reason to take part in the tournament, the S.I.N’s motivation behind it is to collect necessary data from fighters to complete a bio-weapon project BLECE.  GameplayLike most other games in series, Street Fighter IV is a 2D fighting with one-on-one fights between various characters with unique fighting styles and supernatural abilities. The core gameplay is very reminiscent to that of the Street Fighter II, but the game adds many new mechanics, gameplay elements as well as new characters, stages, game modes. The two main gameplay innovations in SFIV are Focus Attacks and Ultra Combos. Focus Attacks are chargeable attacks that can knock down an opponent. It can also absorb one opponent’s strike which gives a new layer to the game combat and makes gameplay less combo-based and more focused on reading the opponent’s moves and fast reactions. Super Combo gauge returns for previous games and allows the player to perform more powerful versions of character’s special attacks. The new Ultra Combo system fills a special Ultra Combo gauge with each hit laid on your character and allows you to unleash a string of powerful attacks on the enemy."

These beams create tunnels without gravity that help to come over obstacles, solve puzzles and even fight enemies. More items become available on higher levels. The game only supports co-op on the same console, with no online multiplayer.While Pid has really hardcore gameplay, its visual style is calm and relaxing. The in-game world is full of secrets and collectibles that balance the gaming experience a little. Almost every NPC has something to tell you, so don't ignore dialogues that will shed some light on Pid's lore."

The Temple of Heroes was chosen as a place to negotiate a truce was established. But something happened and all the kings, never returned home with signs of disease and the King of the North just disappeared. The gameplay and the plotWe have the opportunity to manage the characters of three classes in the genre hack-and-slash RPG. Each of the classes has its own game mechanics. Depending on which of the heroes player chooses - mage, warrior or hunter, the starting location is different. The linear plot and linear hero upgrading might seem confusing at first but the locations themselves and the story, allow you to feel the scale of the game world. Another positive aspect is the possibility of cooperative play, and you can not only play on the network, but also on one computer with a split screen.The developer of the game is the French company Wizarbox, which, in addition to creating its own fantasy worlds, was engaged in porting other games on the console Xbox and PlayStation."

    "about": [
      "Sniper: Ghost Warrior is the second game in Sniper series of tactical shooters with sniping simulation. It is the first game subtitled Ghost Warrior and a spiritual sequel to Sniper: Art of Victory.PlotThe game is set in Latin America, in the deep jungle of a fictional island state Isla Trueno. An enemy power has recently overthrown the local pro-American government. The player assumes control over the US special forces agents and Truenian rebels who fight against the new regime. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior, the player assumes the roles of several main characters, among them a US soldier Tyler Wells who performs sniping and stealth operations, and a local rebel El Tejon who is most useful in open combat.GameplayThere are several types of missions in the game. Some of them emphasize stealth action and marksmanship, while others involve direct firefight. Besides a variety of sniper rifles, the characters can use other silent weapons, such as knives and silenced handguns.The game has a quasi-realistic model of bullet ballistics. The player has to take into account the distance to the target and the bullet's flight time. The wind and the shooter's physical condition also influence the accuracy. In lower difficulty levels, the player can use the system that indicates the designated target and the place of the actual hit."

      "Divekick is the world’s first two-button fighting game. It distills the essence of the fighting game genre into just two buttons with no d-pad directional movement. Divekick’s focused gameplay demonstrates how much depth a single move actually has, and introduces (or reinforces) skills fundamental to the genre: mind games, spacing, timing, and quick reactions.At Iron Galaxy we love fighting games. To the average fan, most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. That’s why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. It’s pure adrenaline, awareness, and outsmarting your enemy. It’s a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form. Key Features14 Completely unique and original characters, each with their own fighting style and special techniques.  Includes two extra playable characters: Fencer from Nidhogg and Johnny Gat from Saints Row!A story for every character in the game, including an intro, ending, and rival battles. You will be moved to tears! Ranked and non-ranked GGPO-powered online multiplayer, the most trusted netcode in fighting games.  Includes ranking boards for each character, as well as overall.Single player plus Local VS multiplayer for two players, with quick and easy button reconfiguration to accommodate a room full of unique personalities.

      "The action \" KILLER is DEAD” takes place in the near future. The world is very similar to the one in which we live but still different. The player controls an executioner named Mondo Zappa. His right hand wields a katana, and the left hand is wholly modified (it can be changed into various forms, including a gun and drill). His goal is to execute heinous criminals scattered all over the world.Playing for Zappa, you will go through twelve story missions selected on the world map. They range from short linear levels to longer levels that require complete investigation. Some level areas also need the activation of interactive objects (e.g. switches) to move forward. During missions Mondo fights with challenging enemies, using a katana and cybernetic weapons. If you use your left hand, camera's angle changes view to the perspective over the shoulder.There are three types of missions in the game: story missions (advance the narrative forward), submissions (they are set at the main missions where Mondo performs various tasks ranging from combat missions to quests), and\" Scarlet \" missions where the female Starlet support character issues combat missions."

The story tells about the formation of Hyperion Corporation and the fate of its head - Handsome Jack, whom we meet while in the role of a simple programmer who dreams to find some valuable artifact. In the game there are various innovations - in the plot, in the characters, in the scenarios of missions and in the setting. For example, on the Pandora satellite, gravity is much weaker, but there is no oxygen at all. Therefore, the task of obtaining oxygen becomes very important for everyone. Moreover, oxygen is needed not only for breathing, but also for the functioning of personal jetpacks and long high jumps. In the game there is another additional story and downloadable content, including new characters and story campaigns."

      "PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX is an arcade game; a part of the Namco Bandai’s long-running PAC-MAN series and a follow-up to the 2007 title PAC-MAN Championship Edition. GameplayThe core gameplay is similar to most other PAC-MAN games. The player controls Pac-Man through the maze where he must eat dots and avoid hostile ghosts. Besides dots, the player can collect bonus items that give additional points, and power pellets that allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts. Eating several ghosts in a row triggers a combo that gives the player a huge amount of extra points. Though the base gameplay is similar to that of the original arcade game, there are numerous new mechanics and gameplay differences in Championship Edition DX. The mazes consist of two halves. Eating all the dots on one of them makes a bonus item appear on the other half and eating an item makes a new dots layout appear on the other side. If a ghost is about to catch Pac-Man, a slow-motion effect kicks in giving the player an opportunity to avoid it. There are three main game modes in the game: Score Attack, Time Attack, and Ghost Combo. The game features nine different courses and several visual style options. DX versionIn 2013, the game was renamed as PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX and received a free update. It featured an upgrade to the online component of the game and new paid downloadable content such as new skins and courses."

As a result, countless variations of Metal Gears have sprung up in every corner of the globe, making the weapon an increasingly common component of the armed forces of nuclear powers. In the midst of all of this, Solid Snake, now a member of the anti-Metal Gear group \"Philanthropy,\" has learned that a new prototype Metal Gear has been developed by the U.S. Marines and is being transported in secret to an unknown destination. To learn more about this new machine, Snake must infiltrate the transport, disguised as a tanker, as it makes its way down the Hudson River. Just as Snake is about to begin his mission, however, the ship is seized by a mysterious and well-armed group bent on stealing the new Metal Gear for their own, nefarious purposes."

      "Mini Ninjas is set in a cartoonish version of medieval Japan and puts you into the role of a cute ninja. Your village was attacked by an Evil Samurai Warlord, who uses magic to turn the innocent animals into his loyal soldiers. There’s no killing and no blood; defeating your enemies will only make them disappear and return to their natural shape. There are six playable characters, although Hiro is the default protagonist. Each of the ninjas has different skills and weapons. Some of the characters can use stealth to avoid the battle or to perform a wall-jump. There are also spells that allow you to fire lightning bolts at your opponents or to turn you into an animal for camouflage and sneaking. The game is full of visual staples about East Asia, such as traditional Japanese lanterns and hats, architecture, bamboo groves, pandas, masked ninjas, and armored samurai. The “chibi” (baby-like) design of the characters, along with their comically high-pitched voices, make all these look like a light-hearted parody rather than actual stereotypes. There are also elements of Japanese mythology such as Tengu, the friendly magic bird people, who trade with the character, provide training, and offer quests."

    "title": "DOOM",
    "about": [
      "Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents) is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as \"Doomguy\", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15–20 million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as \"WADs\". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as \"Doom clones\". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016 and focused on returning to the fast-paced action of the first two games."

    "about": [
      "Among the nations on the Zemurian continent, the mighty Erebonian Empire has been quick to outwardly stake its claim militarily; yet politically, ugly bouts of internal conflict between the upper class and commoners attempting to rise to power have been steadily intensifying day by day. The Noble and Reformist Factions have been none too kind to one another over the years, and tensions between the two only stand to worsen if compromises aren’t made in the very near future.Rean Schwarzer, like any other citizen of the Imperial Nation, is no stranger to these rising conflicts: the class system has been deeply embedded into the hearts of every Erebonian since the days of old. As a seventeen-year-old student preparing for his new life at Thors Military Academy, however, he notices that his crimson uniform differs from the standard ones issued to his peers—typically green for commoners, and white for nobles.Enter, Class VII of Thors Military Academy. For the first time in the prestigious academy’s history, rank means nothing and skill means everything. With nine hand-picked students of various backgrounds and abilities, Rean included, Class VII readies itself to dive deep into the political quagmire that threatens not only them, but the Empire as a whole.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Taking place on the same continent as the fan favorite Trails in the Sky offshoot of Nihon Falcom’s storied The Legend of Heroes franchise, Trails of Cold Steel (Sen no Kiseki in Japanese) is the first in the series to tread Erebonian soil and explore the inner political conflicts of this oft-mentioned powerhouse nation in detail. Delve into the expansive lore that has become synonymous with the series, enjoy school life and bond with fellow students to earn new abilities in battle, take advantage of speedy, tactical turn-based combat with the newly-developed “ARCUS” system, and uncover dramatic events that stand to change everything these two opposing social classes stand for.KEY FEATURESA World Rich in Depth for Veterans and Newcomers AlikeThe events of Trails of Cold Steel are expertly told so that longtime Trails veterans and casual RPG fans alike can equally enjoy its detailed, highly nuanced storyline.New Link System Adds Depth to CombatTake advantage of the Combat Link System by bonding with your allies throughout the school year, netting you a variety of combat benefits including healing, guarding and more.A Sleek Update to a Classic Growth MechanicTrails of Cold Steel streamlines the classic “Orbment” magic system from previous titles with new “ARCUS” units, allowing for more ready access to abilities and quicker customization.Experience the Game as Never Before50% more lines of English voice-overs have been added to the PC release, bringing a fresh experience to even those who have played it before on console."

    "title": "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2",
    "about": [
      "A sequel to Sniper: Ghost Warrior is based on CryEngine 3 and is somewhat similar to such tactical shooters as Crysis.PlotThe protagonist is Cole Anderson, a gruff American ex-Marine, who accompanies a CIA agent on a mission. Their goal is to capture a group of mercenaries who are trying to obtain a biological weapon of mass destruction. The villain, former Russian spy Merinov, is going to sell the weapon to a terrorist organization that plans to provoke a nuclear war. The protagonist will perform a number of stealth military operations in Philippines’ jungle and in the highland of Tibet. There are also playable flashbacks about Anderson’s experiences during the Bosnian conflict that provide more details about his past with Merinov.GameplayJust like its name suggests, the game puts a strong emphasis on sniping. There are many mechanics that aim to make the marksmanship realistic. Each bullet’s trajectory strongly depends on the wind and distance to the target. There’s a HUD that displays the intensity and direction of the wind, allowing the player to aim better. A red dot indicates where the bullet will hit, though this can be disabled in a higher difficulty level. The character’s physical state also influences his accuracy, and after running, he has to rest for a while before shooting. Stealth is also a vital component of the gameplay. Anderson has to sneak past enemy soldiers and cannot survive an open encounter against multiple opponents."

After the last game of the series was published in 1996, reimagining the established format as a first-person shooter, the game was brought back to its roots, returning not only with the improved graphics, engine, and design but with the classic top-down shoot ‘em up genre. Theodore J. Conrad is a space engineer that has to restore the engines after the collision with a mysterious empty ship.Alien Breed: Impact is an updated version of Alien Breed: Evolution that adds not only new designs for the enemy aliens but an entirely new upgrade shop. It has two full story campaigns for both single player and multiplayer. In the multiplayer cooperative campaign, two players are taking the roles of two other survivors, Thadeus and Eddie, that are trying to find Conrad and assist him on his mission."

      "F1 Race Stars is a parody of a Formula One simulation. It renders the F1 racers as wacky characters and their cars as karts.StyleThe game features drivers, teams, and races from the 2012 season of Formula One. However, unlike most simulators, which aim to represent the races realistically, F1 Race Stars is a humorous arcade game. The racers, such as Sebastian Vettel, Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso, and Lewis Hamilton, are depicted as cartoonish versions of themselves. TracksThere's a total of eleven tracks based on the real Formula One circuits. They retained their basic configurations but were enhanced with springboards, loops, traps, and other unrealistic features. The circuits' backgrounds also became comical representations of a country where the race is set in.GameplayAlthough the game is a kart simulation, F1 Race Stars doesn't imitate the actual karting, either. It provides a fictional combination of karting and Formula driving experiences. The cars in the game cannot drift and slide. Instead, the game uses the real-world KERS system to give the car a boost when exiting the corner. The game features power-up in the vein of Super Mario Kart, and some of them are parodies of the actual Formula One elements, such as a safety car. Each team in F1 Race Stars also has a special ability, such as shooting at the opponents for Ferrari or a free boost for Red Bull."

    "title": "Overlord II",
    "about": [
      "This sequel to the comic dark fantasy Overlord allows the player to have fun being evil. You play as the dark Overlord who leads his armies of minions against the human Glorious Empire (which obviously mimics the real-world Roman Empire). The Glorious Empire is not \"good\" anyway: its leaders are trying to eliminate all magic users, so the \"evil\" motivation is quite justified. However, to accomplish his conquest and become a truly powerful and feared dark lord, you will have to commit some really vile deeds. One of your first missions, for example, involves slaughtering baby seals.The game follows the Overlord from his childhood, as he grows from a nasty kid to a mighty dark knight that looks a lot like Sauron as shown in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. The Overlord begins his conquest with a pack of goblins and a single troll, but over time his minions will develop into more powerful and deadly creatures and attack the enemy in large hordes. The game does not turn into a strategy, however, as you still only directly control the dark lord himself, and the minions are commanded through his orders.  Overlord II is famous for its humor: the game does not take itself too seriously. There are all sorts of puns and parodies on the stereotypical villains and other fantasy tropes, such as elves and fairies. Goblin minions squeak, cringe and fall, while playful Danny-Elfman-esque music is echoing in the background."

      "A person from our time experiences visions of the past - and thinks he is sick. Medications do not help, he turns to the shaman. The shaman understands what is going on and talks about the battle that happened 30,000 years ago. The battle between the great hero and the two Sisters of Chaos. One of the Sisters controlled the Light of the Sun, and the other - the Darkness of the Moon. The sisters lost the battle, and the hero imprisoned them. The shaman sees that a person with visions is an incarnation of the hero, and visions can mean that the Sisters managed to escape from prison. Now the hero has to fight the Sisters again.The path to the Sisters lies through several areas. Each area is protected by a Protector. Protectors were independent, but now they are bribed by Chaos and serve Chaos.There are numerous and different beings born from the energies of Light, Darkness or others. These creatures are trying to block the path of the hero. The gameplay arises as the use of the energies of Light and Darkness. The energies of Light are deadly to the creatures of Darkness and vice versa. The game ends when the Sisters are again defeated and will see the beauty of the world and stop wanting to destroy it."

      "This is a flight simulator in the most famous sci-fi universe created by George Lucas. The game was released on the original Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC. The plot of the game unfolds before the Battle of Naboo, and the events of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.The plot tells of the heroic deed of three heroes during the Invasion of Naboo: pilot Rhys Dallows,   Vana Sage, and Feeorin pirate Nym. Three storylines, which at first seem unrelated, along with the course of the development of the plot, combine into one story.Gameplay-wise Starfighter is an arcade spaceflight simulator. The player has to go through more than 14 story missions, which include raids on enemies position, escort cargo, and massive space battles. Critics also note the high quality of graphics for consoles of the sixth generation, and art-direction in general that only increases the movies effect, telling a related story. In the game, the only singleplayer mode is available to play, for multiplayer battles it is required to get a special edition of the game."

He also faces a supernatural threat - Alma, a ghostly creature in the form of a little girl. The game consists of 11 episodes with an epilogue. As for the plot, it is completely confused until the end.One of the primary abilities of the player is to slow down time.  Being in this state for not so long, you can see the traces of flying bullets, move faster and get an advantage in battle.The whole game comes from the first person, and the camera never shows the player from the side. Also, the game is often criticised for the fact that the primary action levels take place inside the buildings, not in the open area. But the player can attack the enemy from anywhere, hiding behind a wall, or create a shelter for additional protection."

It is the third installment of the series.PlotAfter changing his fate, The Prince comes to Babylon accompanied by Kaileena. It turns out that Babylon is under attack. Kaileena gets kidnapped, and The Prince sets out to find her. It is also revealed, that by altering his own fate, The Prince prevented the creation of the Sands of Time from ever happening, so the timeline changes. It is your job to fix it back up.GameplayThe gameplay of The Two Thrones is closer to the first installment in the franchise - the acrobatics play an important role. The combat system is almost the same as it was in the second game. The player still has two weapons (one main and one temporary) and can perform combos. For the first time in the series, the Prince does not have his swords, and a dagger is used instead (replaced with the Dagger of Time later). The temporary weapons now have a certain amount of damage they can sustain. The Prince can now transform into a Dark Prince, whose health goes down quickly, but can be instantly regenerated with sand. Dark Prince's gameplay changes drastically as it encourages fast-paced combat without relying much on tactics. However, all the transformations happen strictly on plot occasions."

It is the first installment of the Splinter Cell franchise.PlotIn 2003, the United States government formed a new covert agency to gather intelligence. It is a top-secret organization named Third Echelon. The agency has access to cutting-edge surveillance and military technologies. Third Echelon's agents are free to violate any law as long as it is required to complete the mission successfully.In 2004, contact is lost with a CIA agent. Homeland security sends a second agent to check on the CIA's asset, yet contact is lost again. Third Echelon sends Sam Fischer to investigate the situation.GameplayThe game's main focus is to hide from the enemy instead of going loud and gun-blazing. The players have to leave no trace of themselves. It is essential to stick to the shadows, use the environment for cover and carefully pick your equipment to avoid detection.Shadows are the best friend of the player. A special indicator is present on an in-game HUD that shows if the players are visible to their enemies. The game does not welcome the usage of weapons as the sound of gunfire is very loud and can be heard from the distance. The players have to rely on headshots, as they don't have much ammo on them. Sam has multiple advanced gadgets to aid him in his mission as well as a lot of hand-to-hand combat experience."

    "about": [
      "Since the 1990 FIFA series has been expanding with each passing year. But the 2012 year was different for the format, because this year when FIFA 13 was released, it was still the time of motion controls. The game supports Kinect, PlayStation Move and version for Wii U includes the touch-based shots, where players can direct the ball precisely while managing and playing the match in real-time. FIFA 13 follows the game modes and features of the previous iteration but adding more current content for the time. For example, adding the Saudi Professional League, bringing back five international teams, yet removing Croatia, due to the licensing disagreement. Newly added game mode FIFA Ultimate team, which gives players the ability to make their own team with real-world players. All professional players are purchased as cards, randomly obtained through card packs. Said cards are divided into three tiers: bronze, silver, and gold, representing their quality."

      "LEGO Batman: The Videogame is a part in the series of LEGO adaptations of popular franchises. It is based on DC Universe and follows its famous superhero, Batman. It was the first LEGO game to be based on an original plot rather than being an adaptation of an existing story.PlotThe game is set in Gotham City. A group of supervillains once again escaped the ever unreliable Arkham Asylum. They formed three separate gangs led by Batman’s arch-enemies Joker, Riddler, and Penguin, respectively. Each gang has a chapter of the game dedicated to it. Riddler’s plan is to rob Gotham's gold reserves. Penguin is going to use his robotic minions to conquer Gotham. Joker wants to poison the whole city with his laughing gas. Batman and Robin have to disrupt the villains’ plans.GameplayThe game is divided into the heroes’ and villains’ missions. In the heroes’ missions, you play as Batman or his aides Robin, Batgirl, and Nightwing, while the playable villains change over the course of the game. Between missions, the characters reside in their respective hubs, Batcave and Arkham Asylum. Each character has his or her unique abilities, such as special weapons, double jumps, mind control or immunity to certain attacks. The player can also change the suits of the characters to use their specific effects. For example, a Glide suit allows Batman to fly short distances, while Robin can use Magnet suit to climb metal surfaces. Since it’s a LEGO game, the player will also have to build certain constructions from LEGO bricks."

    "about": [
      "Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is the third game in the series that was started by Giana Sisters, a 1987 platformer. The original game was a Super Mario rip-off, but, though the new game retained many of the old mechanics (such as defeating enemies by jumping on them), there are also novel gameplay ideas.You play as Giana, a girl who tries to rescue her sister Maria from the hands of an evil dragon Gurglewocky. Giana herself has two different personalities, a \"Cutie\" and a \"Punk\", that can be switched during the game. This change also dramatically alters the environment, allowing the player to shift between two dream worlds: one is a brightly colored garden, while other is a dark, nightmarish forest of giant mushrooms. In both worlds, the levels are nearly identical, despite the aesthetic change. But sometimes the game may demand you to switch to another world to move forward or to obtain a powerup that only exists in one of the worlds.A definitive feature of Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is its music. The score was composed by Chris Hulsbeck, who worked with the original Giana Sisters, and metal band Machinae Supremacy. The soundtrack shifts between “traditional” and \"heavy\" versions of the same compositions to highlight the game's dual nature."

PremiseThe player oversees the breeding of a plant, called Dyson tree, that can grow on comets and asteroids in the vacuum of space. The tree produces seedling that can be used to spread the species to many planetoids. According to the game's backstory, the trees try to make the planets habitable for an ancient extraterrestrial race called Growers who created the trees. They have to fight against a rival species, the greys, who are the evil, mutated version of Dyson trees.GameplayThe game is divided into levels. At the beginning of each level, the trees already inhabit an asteroid. The goal is to spread the trees to other asteroids. The seedlings are the units the player directly controls. They can be used to defend the trees from the enemy seedlings. They can explore the space to find new planetoids. It takes ten seedlings to start growing a tree on a planetoid. Larger asteroids take more time to grow a tree on. However, they eventually reward the player with better seedlings that move faster and have a wider range.StyleEufloria is very minimalist in its visuals. All of its elements are composed of simple geometric shapes. The game is set to equally minimalistic ambient music."

The title revolves around the episodic series-like narrative and puts the importance of the player's choices forward.GameplayThe game resembles the genre of the point-and-click adventures. The players can talk with non-mandatory characters and choose the dialogue options out of four or five alternatives. There is a heavy focus on the QTE — the sequences where one must mash buttons in time accordingly with the pictograms depicted on the screen. At the end of each chapter, the player is presented with the choice diagram — his of her picks are compared to those of the other players across the world.  It is not to be forgotten — Minecraft: Story Mode is the TellTale adaptation of another video game. Fingerprints of this are clear: the crafting mode essential to the original has been added to the game, and the title has become more friendly all in all. That is the contrast with the previous TellTale installments — they were mainly targeting mature audience. StoryThe Story Mode created the narrative from the start — the original game does not feature it. The story centers around Jesse — the protagonist and the player at the same time — who travel around the in-game world in searches for The Order of the Stone."

These points are used to unlock new levels and to compete with other players using the in-game leaderboard.A player customization system is also present in the game.
